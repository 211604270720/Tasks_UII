            "[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  And shame is such a painful, so unpleasant experience,\n",
            "[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  that people usually do not even realize it.\n",
            "[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  It is just so unpleasant to touch this feeling that it is easier not to do anything at all,\n",
            "[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  which can cause my contact with this experience.\n",

            "[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  Well, let's say I was a competent acupuncturist-gynecologist.\n",
            "[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  I worked for seven years.\n",
            "[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  I was really well prepared.\n",

            "[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And I was a wonderful specialist.\n",
            "[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  But when I started selling, I faced a new professional area for myself.\n",

            "[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  And there I was incompetent.\n",
            "[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  And, well, it's scary that people will see it.\n",
            "[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  It's unpleasant.\n",
            "[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  Why am I talking about it so importantly?\n",
            "[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  Because, well, friends, this is the first thing to deal with it somehow.\n",
            "[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  To cope with it and overcome it.\n",
            "[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  And this is absolutely true.\n",
            "[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  This is possible.\n",
            "[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Even for a deep introvert and a deep melancholic like me.\n",
            "[11:49.000 --> 11:54.000]  In order to cope with it and overcome it, you need to notice it first.\n",

            "[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  But to tell yourself that I'm scared.\n",
            "[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  This is normal.\n",
            "[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  This does not prevent me from selling at all.\n",
            "[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  There is such a question.\n",
            "[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  What is the main thing in the business?\n",
            "[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  In any business.\n",
            "[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  What is the main thing in the business?\n",
            "[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Let's say when I was an acupuncturist.\n",
            "[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  In my business, acupuncture, the main thing was to understand whether the births were normal or there was some kind of pathology.\n",
            "[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  And if the births are normal, then remove your hands, do not interfere in them.\n",
            "[12:24.000 --> 12:31.000]  Well, if the births are somehow pathological, then interfere competently.\n",
            "[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  And the truth was the main thing.\n",
            "[12:33.000 --> 12:46.000]  Well, for those who sell their services, who are professionals in some field, and these services need to be sold.\n",
            "[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  This turns out to be the second profession.\n",
            "[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  The most important thing is to make contacts, to talk to people.\n",
            "[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  The quality of how you do it.\n",
            "[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  Well, look, it's not that it doesn't matter.\n",
            "[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  But here is the fundamental thing to allow yourself to do it badly.\n",
            "[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  This is the most fundamental thing.\n",
            "[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  I insist on this.\n",
            "[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  Because so far, while you will think.\n",
            "[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  Well, Evgeny said so many different things that need to be taken into account.\n",
            "[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  Well, how?\n",
            "[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  I will call somehow and I will not take into account something.\n",
            "[13:21.000 --> 13:22.000]  I get confused.\n",
            "[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  It will not be good enough.\n",
            "[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  To hell with it.\n",
            "[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  I specifically sat down when we talked to Dmitry about the preparation of this webinar.\n",
            "[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  And I wrote a few points on two pages about what to talk about.\n",
            "[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  And then I realized that quite a lot of things did not fit there, which I give in my training in sales trainings.\n",
            "[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  Why?\n",
            "[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  I even did it unconsciously.\n",
            "[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  I highlighted some of the most important things.\n",
            "[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  The rest, like meat on bones, has grown.\n",
            "[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  So, one of the main things is to notice this fear in yourself and respond to these fears.\n",
            "[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  You don't need to be perfect.\n",
            "[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  You don't need to be perfect.\n",
            "[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  You just need to do it.\n",
            "[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  Even if you call and are not the person making the decision.\n",
            "[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  Even if you don't get to the director of some company.\n",
            "[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  Even if you call any department, the accountant, and tell some accountant,\n",
            "[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  I'm here about this artificial intelligence for your company.\n",
            "[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  I don't know what it's called.\n",
            "[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  This is already good.\n",
            "[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  Already in some cases, this random accountant will somehow get interested and say,\n",
            "[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  I don't understand anything about this.\n",
            "[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  Let me better connect you with the director.\n",
            "[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  That is, the most important thing is to do it.\n",
            "[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  And the most important thing is to act, allowing yourself to be imperfect.\n",
            "[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Allow yourself to fail.\n",
            "[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  Allow yourself to get into trouble.\n",
            "[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  This is the main thing.\n",
            "[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Against the background of this activity, everything else will grow and happen.\n",
            "[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  True.\n",
            "[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Well, the main fear of the buyer is absolutely correct.\n",
            "[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000]  They wrote about the fear of undesirable external influence.\n",
            "[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  That's how a fortune teller came to the station,\n",
            "[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  and then you were left without earrings.\n",
            "[15:20.000 --> 15:29.000]  And both are very well filmed by the next good thing.\n",
            "[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  It was a direct discovery for me.\n",
            "[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  The mission in the world of the client.\n",
            "[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  This is called.\n",
            "[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  Look, when I just start selling,\n",
            "[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  and even when I sell for some time,\n",
            "[15:49.000 --> 15:57.000]  what is very much in the way of what I meet and what you most likely will meet one way or another,\n",
            "[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  is the feeling of being a beggar.\n",
            "[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  This is the feeling that I am imposing myself.\n",
            "[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  After all, people work normally without me.\n",
            "[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  They don't come to me.\n",
            "[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  And I'm calling.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:11.000]  I distract.\n",
            "[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  Listen, I'm not exaggerating now.\n",
            "[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  These thoughts, in fact, they come to me.\n",
            "[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  They will arise in you.\n",
            "[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  That I distract people from their work.\n",
            "[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  I interfere with their working life.\n",
            "[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  But what right do I have?\n",
            "[16:26.000 --> 16:33.000]  And I clearly remember that I had a moment when I once,\n",
            "[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  from my work as a gynecologist,\n",
            "[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  an experienced professional,\n",
            "[16:44.000 --> 16:45.000]  a professional,\n",
            "[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  who had a job and worked as a gynecologist,\n",
            "[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  was told that he or she was a good person.\n",
            "[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  And I understood that these are good people.\n",
            "[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  Those who meet,\n",
            "[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  who greet,\n",
            "[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  who use the respect of others,\n",
            "[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  obviously.\n",
            "[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  And I've already learned to sell.\n",
            "[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  And I've been deprived of it,\n",
            "[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  because I've been free from work during the evenings and weekends.\n",
            "[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  I have already earned three times more in sales than at my main job.\n",
            "[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  And there was such a situation that money was important for the family.\n",
            "[17:13.000 --> 17:23.200]  were important and I chose, but I remember this moment, I am congratulated that there is a change in\n",
            "[17:23.200 --> 17:27.380]  profession, but I clearly have this feeling that I have become a professional beggar,\n",
            "[17:27.380 --> 17:39.600]  the truth is how much this position of a person who calls, look, the fact is that any\n",
            "[17:39.600 --> 17:47.700]  active sale is always a request, it is a proposal, but it is always a request,\n",
            "[17:47.700 --> 18:02.200]  talk to me, give me time to take my words seriously and if you ask for something\n",
            "[18:02.200 --> 18:08.280]  associated with some kind of position of humiliation, then it will be phony,\n",
            "[18:08.280 --> 18:09.580]  but\n",
            "[18:09.580 --> 18:17.580]  this is the most important thing in life, it is necessary to ask for something, but for\n",
            "[18:17.580 --> 18:22.240]  example, there is a famous one, do not believe do not be afraid do not ask, but I remind you\n",
            "[18:22.240 --> 18:28.540]  that these are the laws of the zone, the laws of the zone are the laws of survival, psychologists\n",
            "[18:28.540 --> 18:34.260]  have a good saying that it is good to survive, it is bad for life to ask, just as to say\n",
            "[18:34.260 --> 18:38.260]  no, just as to say that you want and that you do not want people at all, this is the\n",
            "[18:38.260 --> 18:39.420]  most important social skill,\n",
            "[18:39.420 --> 18:39.520]  but\n",
            "[18:39.520 --> 18:45.280]  who need to learn by themselves and teach their children, this is actually normal, this is not a shame.\n",
            "[18:45.280 --> 18:56.880]  And for me, the turning point here was when I visited at the beginning of the 2000s at the training of Sergey Azimov, a very good sales coach,\n",
            "[18:56.880 --> 19:04.320]  and he said a very simple thing that the deal will only take place if it is beneficial to both sides.\n",
            "[19:04.320 --> 19:16.560]  Listen, don't even worry, we are not great manipulators.\n",
            "[19:16.560 --> 19:30.240]  I have been professionally engaged in practical psychology for 21 years, and practical psychology is the psychology of influence, it is about how to influence yourself and other people, practical psychology is not engaged in anything else.\n",
            "[19:30.240 --> 19:34.240]  So I can't do that.\n",
            "[19:34.240 --> 19:34.280]  Well, I can't do that.\n",
            "[19:34.280 --> 19:34.320]  Well, I can't do that.\n",
            "[19:34.320 --> 19:38.720]  In doing so, I need to hypnotize a certain person so that he does what he really does not need.\n",
            "[19:38.720 --> 19:55.080]  What we are studying today and on the 28th of May and will be learning is how to talk to a person well-meaningly, competently, to remove his thorns so that he is not a hedgehog.\n",
            "[19:55.080 --> 20:04.280]  But this is a conversation of two normal, worthy people who do not lie, do not bluff.\n",
            "[20:04.280 --> 20:11.660]  that only honest, ethical sales are possible. Otherwise, they just won't buy from us.\n",
            "[20:11.660 --> 20:17.960]  If we, God forbid, tried to deceive a person, we are not great actors, it is clear in the eyes.\n",
            "[20:17.960 --> 20:24.860]  But in the same way, it is clear to us when we turn to a person to make him feel good.\n",
            "[20:24.860 --> 20:33.100]  So, the mission in the world of the enemy is some kind of wording that we say inside ourselves,\n",
            "[20:33.100 --> 20:37.740]  for ourselves, and we can say it out loud to a person during a conversation.\n",
            "[20:37.740 --> 20:45.040]  The essence of this phrase is that my goal is for you to feel good with my participation, with me.\n",
            "[20:45.040 --> 20:52.820]  And the phrase that I have been using for many years in sales, in sales, in cold calls,\n",
            "[20:52.820 --> 21:01.420]  when I call, well, usually we go through a secretary, a guard,\n",
            "[21:01.420 --> 21:03.080]  who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard,\n",
            "[21:03.080 --> 21:06.360]  and I feel a sense of pride.\n",
            "[21:06.360 --> 21:07.900]  I feel proud of being a director.\n",
            "[21:07.900 --> 21:16.900]  Today we will analyze these techniques, how to talk to a secretary and how to talk to a person who makes decisions,\n",
            "[21:16.900 --> 21:18.720]  with the headperson.\n",
            "[21:18.720 --> 21:25.340]  Of course, it is better to try to rise to the highest person in the organization who can make decisions.\n",
            "[21:25.340 --> 21:30.280]  But the phrase that I formulated.\n",
            "[21:30.280 --> 21:32.280]  Well, first of all, I say it directly.\n",
            "[21:32.280 --> 21:32.400]  When I introduced myself, Petr Petrovich, when we had a meeting, we were talking about how we could double this and this.\n",
            "[21:32.400 --> 21:32.440]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.440 --> 21:32.460]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.460 --> 21:32.540]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.540 --> 21:32.560]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.560 --> 21:32.620]  This is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.620 --> 21:32.640]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.640 --> 21:32.680]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.680 --> 21:32.760]  And this is what I said.\n",
            "[21:32.760 --> 21:32.880]  And this is what we need to do.\n",
            "[21:32.880 --> 21:32.920]  And this is what we need to do.\n",
            "[21:33.080 --> 21:37.080]  My name is Denis Yakovlev, I am a business coach.\n",
            "[21:37.080 --> 21:42.080]  And then I say to him, Petr Petrovich, I'm calling to set up a business meeting.\n",
            "[21:42.080 --> 21:44.080]  That is, I immediately talk about the goal.\n",
            "[21:44.080 --> 21:46.080]  I do not command, I do not command.\n",
            "[21:46.080 --> 21:48.080]  The goal of the call.\n",
            "[21:48.080 --> 21:50.080]  And then the goal of the meeting.\n",
            "[21:50.080 --> 21:54.080]  Its goal is to find out what we can be interesting and useful for you.\n",
            "[21:54.080 --> 21:58.080]  Well, or what I can be interesting and useful for you.\n",
            "[21:58.080 --> 22:03.080]  If I hear that by voice the person at the end of the cable is more official,\n",
            "[22:03.080 --> 22:06.080]  then I speak in a more official tone.\n",
            "[22:06.080 --> 22:15.220]  If he speaks more reluctantly, more fun, somehow more\n",
            "[22:15.220 --> 22:17.220]  I can rephrase a little and say, Petr Petrovich, I'm calling to set up a business meeting.\n",
            "[22:17.220 --> 22:23.220]  Its goal is to find out what I can be interesting and useful for you at all.\n",
            "[22:23.220 --> 22:25.220]  Well, I agree with the national state.\n",
            "[22:25.220 --> 22:28.080]  There may be variations, but this is the essence.\n",
            "[22:28.080 --> 22:31.080]  My goal is not to sell this.\n",
            "[22:31.080 --> 22:35.080]  And this is also a fundamental thing.\n",
            "[22:35.080 --> 22:38.080]  The first thing is to notice your fear.\n",
            "[22:38.080 --> 22:42.080]  And allow yourself to be imperfect.\n",
            "[22:42.080 --> 22:44.080]  And understand what is the main thing in the business.\n",
            "[22:44.080 --> 22:47.080]  The main thing is not to be perfect at all.\n",
            "[22:47.080 --> 22:49.080]  Make contacts, fail, get rejections.\n",
            "[22:49.080 --> 22:51.080]  But do it.\n",
            "[22:51.080 --> 22:57.080]  And the second is with what inner message to enter into these contacts.\n",
            "[22:57.080 --> 22:58.080]  What is it?\n",
            "[22:58.080 --> 23:02.080]  My goal at this moment is not to sell outsourcing,\n",
            "[23:02.080 --> 23:08.080]  not to sell the creation of a neural network of artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[23:08.080 --> 23:14.080]  A few years ago, there was the biggest sale in my life,\n",
            "[23:14.080 --> 23:18.080]  when I sold one of my training days for 200,000 pure rubles.\n",
            "[23:18.080 --> 23:22.080]  Plus, I was paid a flight from Arkhangelsk, where I live, to Moscow and back,\n",
            "[23:22.080 --> 23:24.080]  plus 6% tax.\n",
            "[23:24.080 --> 23:26.080]  It was all official.\n",
            "[23:26.080 --> 23:30.080]  But I never received 200,000 rubles for a training day before or after.\n",
            "[23:30.080 --> 23:38.080]  And at first I met with the leaders of the middle class in the organization.\n",
            "[23:38.080 --> 23:40.080]  You will also have this.\n",
            "[23:40.080 --> 23:43.080]  It is necessary in some cases that first you meet not with the first person,\n",
            "[23:43.080 --> 23:45.080]  even when you try.\n",
            "[23:45.080 --> 23:47.080]  And this is a completely normal thing.\n",
            "[23:47.080 --> 23:49.080]  And we talked to them.\n",
            "[23:49.080 --> 23:51.080]  I asked them.\n",
            "[23:51.080 --> 23:53.080]  That's what we're going to start with today.\n",
            "[23:53.080 --> 23:55.080]  And on the 28th, we will continue the funnel of questions.\n",
            "[23:55.080 --> 23:56.080]  That's all.\n",
            "[23:56.080 --> 23:57.080]  I did it.\n",
            "[23:57.080 --> 23:59.080]  I put them to myself.\n",
            "[23:59.080 --> 24:02.080]  I immediately told them what I can't give them, and what I can give.\n",
            "[24:02.080 --> 24:07.080]  Well, also honestly, I always start my offer with the minuses of my offer.\n",
            "[24:07.080 --> 24:10.080]  When I asked a person, I immediately said no.\n",
            "[24:10.080 --> 24:13.080]  What I won't give him.\n",
            "[24:13.080 --> 24:14.080]  First of all, it's honest.\n",
            "[24:14.080 --> 24:16.080]  Secondly, it sharply increases my confidence.\n",
            "[24:16.080 --> 24:21.080]  And then I say how I can be useful to him and his organization.\n",
            "[24:21.080 --> 24:25.080]  But the next level was a meeting with a person who accepts, of course,\n",
            "[24:25.080 --> 24:28.080]  the final decision about the training of the executive director.\n",
            "[24:28.080 --> 24:34.080]  And I knew that on this day he would meet with several other trainers of other organizations.\n",
            "[24:34.080 --> 24:37.080]  And he will choose.\n",
            "[24:37.080 --> 24:39.080]  I come in advance.\n",
            "[24:39.080 --> 24:41.080]  I prepared a presentation.\n",
            "[24:41.080 --> 24:43.080]  And I feel that I am worried.\n",
            "[24:43.080 --> 24:45.080]  I start shaking.\n",
            "[24:45.080 --> 24:48.080]  Although, in fact, I am a professional salesman.\n",
            "[24:48.080 --> 24:51.080]  But you remember that I didn't go anywhere with the donkeys.\n",
            "[24:51.080 --> 24:53.080]  I stay with the donkeys.\n",
            "[24:53.080 --> 24:54.080]  I have the same character.\n",
            "[24:54.080 --> 24:56.080]  I just learned something.\n",
            "[24:56.080 --> 25:03.080]  And moreover, those same middle-class managers walk past me in the office.\n",
            "[25:03.080 --> 25:04.080]  They are sick for me.\n",
            "[25:04.080 --> 25:05.080]  They are worried.\n",
            "[25:05.080 --> 25:08.080]  And they say, Evgeny, have you prepared a presentation?\n",
            "[25:08.080 --> 25:10.080]  Evgeny, you have a good presentation.\n",

            "[59:32.020 --> 59:33.020]  We are honest.\n",
            "[59:33.020 --> 59:34.020]  The market is changing.\n",
            "[59:34.020 --> 59:39.020]  We have clarified and if it turns out that no, we will be the first to tell him about it.\n",
            "[59:39.020 --> 59:44.020]  If yes, then maybe he will find it interesting and he will want to introduce it.\n",
            "[59:44.020 --> 59:46.020]  But so far we do not know.\n",
            "[59:46.020 --> 59:50.020]  Therefore, what do we sell at the cold call?\n",
            "[59:50.020 --> 01:00:00.020]  We sell a meeting, not artificial intelligence, but a meeting on which to clarify, in fact, maybe it is interesting and useful for him to introduce artificial intelligence into his enterprise.\n",
            "[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.020]  And this is completely interchangeable.\n",
            "[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.020]  And that's why we have an intonation of a formal question.\n",
            "[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:12.020]  We are really an adequate person who is now calling and talking to an adequate person with an adequate purpose for both purposes.\n",
            "[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.020]  Offers perfectly interchangeable things.\n",
            "[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:19.020]  And when you know this and do not doubt it, confidence has a light hypnotic effect.\n",
            "[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.020]  This does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\n",
            "[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.020]  It does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\n",
            "[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.020]  It does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\n",
            "[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.020]  It does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\n",
            "[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.020]  It does not guarantee that a person will say yes to you.\n",
            "[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:39.020]  But clearly, at times, the intonation of a confident address, this state, the inner message, increases the probability.\n",
            "[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020]  This is clear.\n",
            "[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.020]  This is a statistic that a person reacts to it.\n",
            "[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.020]  You tell him interchangeable things and he answers interchangeably.\n",
            "[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:55.020]  When we start to speak uncertainly, we start to speak from below, the person, if we ourselves ...\n",
            "[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.020]  He subconsciously reads that we are not confident in our offer.\n",
            "[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.020]  If we are not confident in our offer, why should he be confident in it?\n",
            "[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.020]  He says no.\n",
            "[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.020]  It is easier for him to say no.\n",
            "[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:12.020]  And now, with the permission of Dmitry, I will include a recording.\n",
            "[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:21.020]  I asked him to tell me how he sees a conversation with a potential client.\n",
            "[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.020]  How does he generally propose to talk?\n",
            "[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.020]  And Dmitry ...\n",
            "[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:30.020]  Dmitry dictated some text.\n",
            "[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.020]  Well, usually I speak.\n",
            "[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.020]  Usually I teach to speak like this.\n",
            "[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.020]  And I think that Dmitry has already, perhaps, spoken about this with you or will speak.\n",
            "[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:49.020]  But now I will turn on his voice so that you listen to the correspondence with these three technical criteria that I have already written.\n",
            "[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:53.020]  Just a second.\n",
            "[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.020]  So.\n",
            "[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:11.020]  Well, I don't know how it will turn out, but I hope that everything will be heard well.\n",
            "[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:20.020]  When it comes to a meeting, I usually say that, look, the artificial intelligence is now starting to be used everywhere.\n",
            "[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020]  All companies.\n",
            "[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.020]  Now I have not heard of a single company that you have not already used, or I have already thought of you.\n",
            "[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.020]  That is, the whole market goes there.\n",
            "[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:33.020]  This is the same as the Internet 20-30 years ago.\n",
            "[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.020]  Do you hear the intonation?\n",
            "[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.020]  Dmitry is now speaking on equal terms.\n",
            "[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:42.020]  Not from below and not from above.\n",
            "[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.020]  Although it seems like he is reporting some information that, perhaps, the interlocutors do not know.\n",
            "[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:52.020]  But Dmitry seems to describe the picture of the world as it is.\n",
            "[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.020]  The world is such.\n",
            "[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:59.020]  And he respects the interlocutor.\n",
            "[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.020]  This is exactly the position, well, by the methods of exclusion, not from above, not from above.\n",
            "[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.020]  Ha, you don't know, now I'll tell you.\n",
            "[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.020]  Well, you understand, the world goes there.\n",
            "[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020]  On equal terms, clearly.\n",
            "[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.020]  I am a professional, I inform.\n",
            "[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020]  Perhaps you know about it yourself.\n",
            "[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.020]  But in any case, it is so.\n",
            "[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.020]  Dmitry speaks directly.\n",
            "[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.020]  About the topic of the conversation.\n",
            "[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.020]  Not Yulid.\n",
            "[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:35.020]  And he says, as if with no doubt, that the interlocutor perceives this normally.\n",
            "[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:39.020]  That he is certainly ready to hear it and ready to take it into account.\n",
            "[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.020]  Let's listen further.\n",
            "[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:46.020]  Now, in the end, there are only companies in the world with the Internet, and there are no companies without the Internet.\n",
            "[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.020]  The same will now be with the Internet.\n",
            "[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.020]  This is a similar case.\n",
            "[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:57.020]  The same will now be with artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.020]  We have no doubt that this is so.\n",
            "[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:03.020]  We are describing the real picture of the world.\n",
            "[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.020]  The grass is green.\n",
            "[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.020]  The sky is blue.\n",
            "[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.020]  The water is wet.\n",
            "[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.020]  The same with artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.020]  This is confidence.\n",
            "[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.020]  Not a plumb, not a push from above, not a dictation.\n",
            "[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:21.020]  Accordingly, this is the same with artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.020]  According to these three things.\n",
            "[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:28.020]  But at the same time, almost no one knows how to apply it.\n",
            "[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.020]  Because there are no experts.\n",
            "[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.020]  Actually, I propose a meeting where I will talk to you.\n",
            "[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.020]  Look what Dmitry is doing now.\n",
            "[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.020]  This is an amazing thing.\n",
            "[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.020]  But no one knows how to apply it.\n",
            "[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.020]  He is now removing the shame.\n",
            "[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:49.020]  Remember that it is very unpleasant for any person to face his ignorance, his incompetence.\n",
            "[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.020]  Very unpleasant.\n",
            "[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:58.020]  And a person, in order to avoid meeting with this experience, can refuse to meet.\n",
            "[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.020]  And what Dmitry said.\n",
            "[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.020]  But now no one.\n",
            "[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.020]  That you are exactly in the same position in which everyone else is now.\n",
            "[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.020]  This is normal.\n",
            "[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.020]  You are a normal, adequate person.\n",
            "[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.020]  This is also a message that I am a normal, adequate person who knows about artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.020]  And you are a normal, adequate person who knows nothing.\n",
            "[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.020]  And the mind cannot be applied as artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.020]  You cannot be applied as artificial intelligence in your company.\n",
            "[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.020]  This is normal.\n",
            "[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020]  You and I are normal, adequate people.\n",
            "[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:32.020]  And before we listen to what Dmitry is saying further.\n",
            "[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.020]  Now the next slide.\n",
            "[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.020]  Look.\n",
            "[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.020]  If we actively enter the company, not at the invitation.\n",
            "[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.020]  We are active.\n",
            "[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.020]  Activity, in essence, is always aggression.\n",
            "[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.020]  But this is an invasion.\n",
            "[01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:00.020]  We really call a person during his working day.\n",
            "[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:05.020]  We really switch a person from some of his daily work.\n",
            "[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:14.020]  And then, indeed, either out of fear of being aggressive, not to act at all, not to get in touch.\n",
            "[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.020]  Well, out of fear of being insolent.\n",
            "[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.020]  Well, to be ashamed of it.\n",
            "[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.020]  Or with this.\n",
            "[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.020]  Or to do something with it.\n",
            "[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:25.020]  And then the fourth component of confident appeal.\n",
            "[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.020]  If we add sincerity to our activity.\n",
            "[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:34.020]  Remember now what and how Dmitry says in this record.\n",
            "[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:42.020]  Sincereness, openness, kindness, warmth, care for the interlocutor.\n",
            "[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.020]  Then it will be perceived as confidence.\n",
            "[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:51.020]  The fourth component, the fifth element, remember there.\n",
            "[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.020]  The fourth component is warmth.\n",
            "[01:06:54.020 --> 01:07:01.020]  If there is no warmth, then the first three components without it will be perceived as aggression.\n",
            "[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:08.020]  How to make your speech sound warm?\n",
            "[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.020]  Well, listen.\n",
            "[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.020]  It is clear that this is a mood.\n",
            "[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.020]  That we are allies here.\n",
            "[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.020]  The mission of the world of the enemy.\n",
            "[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.020]  This is all we talked about.\n",
            "[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.020]  But there is also a very simple technical technique.\n",
            "[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:23.020]  This is when you do such a half-moon.\n",
            "[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:28.020]  And it's not about how sincerely and warmly you must smile to the interlocutor.\n",
            "[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.020]  By the way, now I am smiling too much.\n",
            "[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.020]  And this is not perceived as a sincere smile.\n",
            "[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:39.020]  Purely mechanically, when we raise the corners of our lips, then our voice begins to sound warmer.\n",
            "[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:45.020]  Purely mechanically, when we raise the corners of our lips, then our voice begins to sound warmer.\n",
            "[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:50.020]  Look, I'm not doing anything but changing this little mimicry.\n",
            "[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020]  Try it.\n",
            "[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:07:54.020 --> 01:08:04.020]  And now, taking into account what we have talked about, let's listen to what and how Dmitry says here.\n",
            "[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.020]  Just a second.\n",
            "[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:14.020]  Hello, there are 3-5 options for application.\n",
            "[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.020]  Next, your question is whether they will be profitable for you, whether they will be profitable for you now.\n",
            "[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.020]  But you will look at it and say.\n",
            "[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:27.020]  If we choose, it turns out that nothing is profitable, but okay.\n",
            "[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.020]  Dmitry is doing two powerful things now, but these are already nuances.\n",
            "[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:38.020]  Again, now the most important thing to pay attention to is the correspondence with these four things.\n",
            "[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.020]  But I can't help but say it.\n",
            "[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.020]  Dmitry is doing the so-called program setting.\n",
            "[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:53.020]  He very calmly tells the interlocutor what will happen, what you will do with him.\n",
            "[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020]  Program setting.\n",
            "[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.020]  He is sure, he knows what will happen.\n",
            "[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.020]  Look, very often, it's really funny.\n",
            "[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:08.020]  I agreed on a meeting, and here we meet with the interlocutor, and he is a little confused.\n",
            "[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.020]  Well, we met, but how to say.\n",
            "[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.020]  And out of this confusion, a person usually comes out.\n",
            "[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.020]  In such a way that he offers to tell something to me.\n",
            "[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.020]  He says, Evgeny, well, tell me about your proposal.\n",
            "[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  Well, you can't, it's impossible.\n",
            "[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:27.020]  If you haven't asked the person, it's in vain to offer him something, to tell him.\n",
            "[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.020]  It will be missed, it will not be for him.\n",
            "[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.020]  Therefore, I always take initiative into my own hands.\n",
            "[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:39.020]  And I say, Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you.\n",
            "[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020]  Can I ask you a few questions?\n",
            "[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.020]  Let it be.\n",
            "[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:46.020]  After the 24th year, they always say yes.\n",
            "[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:55.020]  There was not a single case in my practice, well, in real meetings, if we had already agreed on a meeting about sales, that a person would say no to me.\n",
            "[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.020]  Again, do you hear how these four criteria sound?\n",
            "[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:03.020]  Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you.\n",
            "[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:09.020]  Can I ask him a few questions?\n",
            "[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.020]  And the setting of the program.\n",
            "[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:19.020]  And the second thing that sounded great here in this excerpt is that Dmitry gives the opportunity to the interlocutor to say no.\n",
            "[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:25.020]  He directly says that we don't know if it will come in handy or not.\n",
            "[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.020]  But if it doesn't come in handy, well, we just won't continue, it's reasonable.\n",
            "[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020]  And this is a very important thing.\n",
            "[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:38.020]  Remember, the main fear of the buyer, we said at the very beginning, is the fear of unwanted external subconscious influence.\n",
            "[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.020]  That somehow your teeth will speak to you.\n",
            "[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.020]  And you will spend money, and then you will feel like a fool.\n",
            "[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:56.020]  So when we speak confidently, and at the same time I specifically at each stage of sales, I just came to the fact that at each stage of sales I am building up this opportunity to say no.\n",
            "[01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:04.020]  At the stage of the offer, I start with the minuses of my offer.\n",
            "[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.020]  At the stage of finding out the needs, we will talk to you about the funnel of questions.\n",
            "[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.020]  And then I will tell you.\n",
            "[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.020]  At some point I will definitely say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that you are simply guided.\n",
            "[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:23.020]  That is, I tell him again that I'm not trying to sell him now, he needs to make a decision about the purchase now.\n",
            "[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:29.020]  Or I can say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature.\n",
            "[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:33.020]  I'm not selling you now, and this is very important.\n",
            "[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.020]  This is very relaxing for a person and causes trust.\n",
            "[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.020]  This is just what is now.\n",
            "[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.020]  I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature.\n",
            "[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.020]  That is, I'm not selling you now and this is very important.\n",
            "[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:42.020]  Well, Dmitry does it in this excerpt as well.\n",
            "[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:48.020]  If we choose something that will be profitable, I will take into account the cost of the budget,\n",
            "[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:53.020]  so that it is clear to you more accurately how profitable it is.\n",
            "[01:11:53.020 --> 01:12:01.020]  Further, if everything is okay here, then we make a free pilot project to show and confirm at your base\n",
            "[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:07.020]  that we can really do it and make sure for ourselves, that is, we make a pilot for ourselves,\n",
            "[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:12.020]  in order to take only those projects that will really work and not take those projects that will not work,\n",
            "[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.020]  because artificial intelligence is a very unpredictable topic.\n",
            "[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.020]  That is, there may be two tasks, but in one company you have one and the other.\n",
            "[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:23.020]  The first one will work, the second one will not. It happens.\n",
            "[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.020]  Actually, that's what I mean.\n",
            "[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:33.020]  Yes, and further Dmitry gives examples of how he deals with doubts and objections.\n",
            "[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:37.020]  But look, the most important thing, what is important for me here,\n",
            "[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:49.020]  in addition to the demonstration of what these four technical terms of confident appeal look like in the conversation,\n",
            "[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:57.020]  is that you always say sensible, understandable things.\n",
            "[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.020]  You don't need to invent anything here.\n",
            "[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.020]  You just need to say what it is.\n",
            "[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.020]  And don't be afraid to say what it is.\n",
            "[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.020]  It's not about that it may turn out that it doesn't fit.\n",
            "[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.020]  It may turn out that it will fit, but not in a profitable way.\n",
            "[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.020]  And then we will finish on this.\n",
            "[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.020]  It's okay, it's normal.\n",
            "[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.020]  That is, we say it directly as it is.\n",
            "[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:30.020]  This is a striking thing, that really good sales is when we say it directly as it is with respect to ourselves and our interlocutor.\n",
            "[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:36.020]  But, such an important thing, just a daily conversation does not lead to sales.\n",
            "[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:40.020]  This is still a conversation that is arranged in a certain way,\n",
            "[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.020]  certain speech patterns are prepared,\n",
            "[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.020]  really correct intonation, correct state,\n",
            "[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.020]  not in order to deceive a person and sell him what he does not need,\n",
            "[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:56.020]  but in order to take these little needles, the fears of the buyer.\n",
            "[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.020]  Just a second, I'll take a look.\n",
            "[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:02.020]  Perhaps there are still some questions for me here that I don't see.\n",
            "[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.020]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020]  Perhaps the meeting is arranged through email?\n",
            "[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020]  Listen, it's better to call and it's better to reach out to meet.\n",
            "[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]  If it doesn't work out anymore, then through correspondence.\n",
            "[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.020]  It's hard to hear Dmitry's phrase, half a word is not clear.\n",
            "[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.020]  I have the maximum volume here.\n",
            "[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.020]  Okay.\n",
            "[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.020]  Well, yes, okay.\n",
            "[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:15.020]  How did it turn out?\n",
            "[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.020]  Yes, yes.\n",
            "[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.020]  Yes.\n",

            "[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.020]  Well, yes.\n",
            "[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020]  Yes.\n",

            "[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:59.780]  good enough thing, the main message of confident address, I am the sun, you are the sun, and I offer you a\n",
            "[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:14.880]  cool thing, here is the intonation and the message these are another very important internal thing\n",

            "[01:15:52.260 --> 01:16:02.260]  Well, about the fact that you don't need it, you actually remind yourself every time you give a person the opportunity to refuse.\n",
            "[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:22.260]  Well, as Dmitry said, I don't know how much it was heard or not heard, that the meaning was that it may turn out that this is not suitable for you.\n",
            "[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:29.260]  In general, the introduction of artificial intelligence is now, in principle, not suitable. And then it's okay, and then we'll finish.\n",
            "[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:40.260]  And then he said that if we find out that it is suitable, it will be necessary to calculate whether it is profitable for you or not, and it may turn out to be unprofitable.\n",
            "[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:49.260]  And this will also be a normal result. We will understand this. And if we understand that it will be profitable, look, when Dmitry said this,\n",
            "[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.260]  he actually stated that he did not need it.\n",
            "[01:16:52.260 --> 01:17:00.260]  And then he said that he really did not need it and he now has this ability to sell it to this interlocutor.\n",
            "[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.260]  But at the same time, there was clearly a curiosity both in the text and in the voice.\n",
            "[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:10.260]  I want to meet with you, I want to figure it out, I want to cooperate with you.\n",
            "[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:16.260]  And this is a very important message. And both.\n",
            "[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:21.260]  There will be no I want, there will be just a formal speech of the text.\n",

            "[01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  I said, good afternoon, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev, the center of practical psychology of information.\n",
            "[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:07.200]  Well, when we parted and I began to represent only myself, I began to simply say that I am a business trainer.\n",
            "[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  Next, what did I say?\n",
            "[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:22.200]  God, I said, yes, I asked, tell me, who in your company is engaged in personnel training?\n",
            "[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:30.200]  I was often sent, especially if there is a small company, and there is no special HR there,\n",
            "[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  a person who deals with personnel, I was sent directly to the director, well, or to the HR, which also satisfied me.\n",
            "[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.200]  In your situation, this question, tell me, who is engaged in the introduction of artificial intelligence?\n",
            "[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:45.200]  Well, an absurd one.\n",
            "[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.200]  Most likely, no one.\n",
            "[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:54.200]  At the same time, you really need to go, perhaps, to a higher person in the organization.\n",
            "[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.200]  If there is a general director there, then to the general director.\n",
            "[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:01.200]  Well, why?\n",
            "[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:07.200]  It is clear that the higher the position of a person in the organization, the more information he has about all departments.\n",
            "[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:14.200]  Because it is not clear to you yet in which department the technology can work, be required for them.\n",
            "[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:17.200]  The second is a person who makes decisions.\n",
            "[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:24.200]  And it was also a revelation for me, although I, in general, was not a naive person, when I encountered in practice once,\n",
            "[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  and not for the first year of my work, I suddenly made this amazing discovery,\n",
            "[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  that you are talking to some one deputy director about how things are going for them and what they need.\n",
            "[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:45.200]  Here, they talked in detail, you make a proposal, then you meet with another organization leader,\n",
            "[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:50.200]  well, let's say, actually, with the director, and everything is completely different for him.\n",
            "[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  Not only the idea of goals, but also the picture in general, how and what works in their organizations,\n",
            "[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.200]  it may not coincide at all.\n",
            "[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.200]  As if they work in different worlds.\n",
            "[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.200]  It is clear that this is about some imperfection of their interaction in the organization.\n",
            "[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.200]  But listen.\n",
            "[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.200]  We are definitely dealing with imperfect organizations.\n",
            "[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  Each of them has its own problems.\n",
            "[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  Therefore, if you are not talking to the first person in the organization,\n",
            "[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.200]  you went to some leader, but he is not the first person in the organization,\n",
            "[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:27.200]  then you can talk to him about everything and make a pilot project on the basis of your conversation.\n",
            "[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  But when the decision will then be made by the senior person,\n",
            "[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:35.200]  it may go to the cat's tail, unfortunately, in some cases.\n",
            "[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.200]  Because the senior...\n",
            "[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.200]  The senior person may have a different opinion.\n",
            "[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:45.200]  This does not mean that we are neglecting...\n",
            "[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.200]  Yes, this does not mean that we are neglecting to somehow say,\n",
            "[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  no, only either with the general director,\n",
            "[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  or I will not meet with anyone there to talk in the organization.\n",
            "[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.200]  But also this moment to understand that, first of all,\n",
            "[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  we strive to meet with the higher person in the organization as much as possible.\n",
            "[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.200]  And if we meet not with the higher person,\n",
            "[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.200]  then we try to go through him to the higher person.\n",
            "[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  Yes, we talk to him.\n",
            "[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.200]  Yes, we interest him.\n",
            "[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.200]  We establish a contact.\n",
            "[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:16.200]  We find out his picture.\n",
            "[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.200]  But this is an intermediate link.\n",
            "[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.200]  Let it not sound cynical.\n",
            "[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:24.200]  This is a step in order to go to the general director.\n",
            "[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:31.200]  There is a phrase that I have further written in this presentation.\n",
            "[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.200]  If we go to some leader, not the higher person,\n",
            "[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.200]  not the chief director of the organization,\n",
            "[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.200]  we can ask, Petr Petrovich,\n",
            "[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:46.200]  if you like everything and you want to implement it in your organization,\n",
            "[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:51.200]  is there anyone else who needs to be advised about this?\n",
            "[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:54.200]  Who will take part in the decision-making?\n",
            "[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:58.200]  And, let's say, he says, yes, there is such a person.\n",
            "[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  You explain the person or the circle of faces,\n",
            "[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.200]  and then you suggest.\n",
            "[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:04.200]  First of all, he says,\n",
            "[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.200]  Petr Petrovich,\n",
            "[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.200]  can we meet with them then?\n",
            "[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:10.200]  Well, so as not to get up twice.\n",
            "[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.200]  Don't be afraid of that.\n",
            "[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.200]  Well, it won't work out, it won't work out.\n",
            "[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.200]  Then you will talk to this person for now.\n",
            "[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:20.200]  But at the earliest stage,\n",
            "[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.200]  if you like everything and you want to implement it in yourself,\n",
            "[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:29.200]  then who else in the organization will need to talk about it?\n",
            "[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.200]  What opinion to take into account,\n",
            "[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.200]  with whom else to agree?\n",
            "[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.200]  And then you immediately, you remember,\n",
            "[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  directly, without asking,\n",
            "[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:39.200]  we offer the person to already be included in the meeting.\n",
            "[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:41.200]  Three, four.\n",
            "[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.200]  Yes.\n",
            "[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.200]  Script, which is, well, such a standard, basic.\n",
            "[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.200]  I offer you.\n",
            "[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:51.200]  I'm calling about the use of artificial intelligence in your company.\n",
            "[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.200]  That is, well, what am I talking about?\n",
            "[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:56.200]  Can I talk to your director?\n",
            "[01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.200]  Do you remember the intonation of the formal question?\n",
            "[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.200]  There is still such a little, well,\n",
            "[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.200]  intonation shock.\n",
            "[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:06.200]  You kind of hint at the answer.\n",
            "[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.200]  Can I talk to your director?\n",
            "[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.200]  Can you wash your hands?\n",
            "[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:13.200]  Tell me, could you give me 100 rubles?\n",
            "[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.200]  Well, the intonation is.\n",
            "[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:17.200]  Is it possible?\n",
            "[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.200]  You kind of have no doubt that you can.\n",
            "[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:25.200]  And so listen to this intonation accent.\n",
            "[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.200]  Can I talk to your director?\n",
            "[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.200]  I'm a little breathing pause.\n",
            "[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200]  It kind of emphasizes this word.\n",
            "[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.200]  I can talk.\n",
            "[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:36.200]  And you can still, even if you talk on the phone,\n",
            "[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:38.200]  nod a little bit assertively.\n",
            "[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.200]  I can talk to your director.\n",
            "[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.200]  This is natural.\n",
            "[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.200]  The grass is green.\n",
            "[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.200]  The water is wet.\n",
            "[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200]  The sky is blue.\n",
            "[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.200]  I can talk to your director.\n",
            "[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.200]  Confident appeal.\n",
            "[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200]  Remember?\n",
            "[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:53.200]  On equal terms, directly with the intonation of the formal question and warmth.\n",
            "[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:56.200]  And what is his name?\n",
            "[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.200]  Uh-huh.\n",
            "[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.200]  If you are told.\n",
            "[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.200]  Now he is busy.\n",
            "[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:05.200]  Could you give me his contact phone number?\n",
            "[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.200]  There was a funny story, too, in the same city.\n",
            "[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:17.200]  When I literally call the store on the yellow pages of the guidebook.\n",
            "[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:20.200]  And I turn to the manager.\n",
            "[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:21.200]  Well, who is the seller?\n",
            "[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.200]  The manager picks up the phone.\n",
            "[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.200]  I ask him.\n",
            "[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200]  I imagine.\n",
            "[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.200]  I ask who in their organization is engaged in training staff.\n",
            "[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.200]  He nods.\n",
            "[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.200]  Well, probably the director.\n",
            "[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.200]  I say.\n",
            "[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.200]  Uh-huh.\n",
            "[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.200]  The director.\n",
            "[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.200]  Tell me, what is his name?\n",
            "[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.200]  Dmitry Eduardovich.\n",
            "[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.200]  I still remember Dmitry Eduardovich.\n",
            "[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.200]  Could you give me his contact phone number?\n",
            "[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.200]  He gives.\n",
            "[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.200]  I call.\n",
            "[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.200]  I agree on a meeting with Dmitry Eduardovich.\n",
            "[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.200]  The first question at the meeting.\n",
            "[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:41.200]  Who gave you my phone number?\n",
            "[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.200]  And then it comes to me.\n",
            "[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.200]  I didn't even realize that I applied the technique.\n",
            "[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.200]  This is already becoming a skill.\n",
            "[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.200]  And, well, I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:49.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.200]  I don't know.\n",
            "[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:55.200]  I don't know.\n",

            "[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:38.120]  Look, if they say, you leave your phone number and he will call you back, if anything.\n",
            "[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:50.120]  Well, of course, you need to leave your phone number, but it is extremely unlikely that the director will somehow actively call you back in this situation.\n",

            "[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.120]  Well, the person says, for example, Olga.\n",

            "[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:30.120]  Well, if a person says ...\n",
            "[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:39.120]  There are very different organizations, including those that may require emotional, I wanted to say, artificial intelligence.\n",

            "[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:04.120]  And then this appeal, Olga, Irina, could you help me?\n",
            "[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:06.120]  Why does it work?\n",
            "[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:09.120]  This is a personal appeal for help.\n",
            "[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  This is one of the heuristics.\n",
            "[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  Heuristics in social psychology are called thinking automatisms, reaction automatisms.\n",

            "[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.120]  Then what do we do?\n",
            "[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]  We appeal in a compulsive inclination.\n",
            "[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120]  Tell me, could you help me?\n",

            "[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:13.120]  And if you thought about using artificial intelligence, what would be important for you, first of all?\n",
            "[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.120]  And people suddenly start talking.\n",

            "[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:18.880]  joining. Look, what Dmitry, I think we will listen to his resolution in the next webinar,\n",

            "[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:34.580]  Or it may be a more detailed explanation. But what Dmitry said in the excerpt that we listened to,\n",
            "[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.080]  he actually explained quite elaborately. Well, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say.\n",
            "[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:44.120]  And it sounded very clear, very clear, very logical, and it took quite a bit of time.\n",
            "[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:52.020]  And if by this sample, it will be something like this, Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail.\n",
            "[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:56.580]  I call precisely in order to prepare an offer for your company.\n",
            "[02:10:56.580 --> 02:11:00.020]  Olga, the technology of artificial intelligence and neural networks is a completely new area.\n",
            "[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:03.760]  In companies, there are most often no specialists who are already engaged in this.\n",
            "[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.080]  That is why the first conversation with the turner is very important.\n",
            "[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.080]  And this is what we are doing with the director.\n",
            "[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.080]  I am calling your director now to agree on a meeting.\n",
            "[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:13.080]  Could you connect me with him?\n",
            "[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:20.080]  Well, look, I am now speaking a little impatiently, a little with a teacher's intonation.\n",
            "[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:28.080]  And this is due to the fact that I see that there are nine minutes left until the end of the webinar, and I am in a hurry.\n",
            "[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.080]  Purely technically.\n",
            "[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:36.080]  And if we speak faster, it can create a sense of uncertainty.\n",
            "[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:41.080]  A sense of impatience, some kind of impatience of ours.\n",
            "[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.080]  What makes a person impatient?\n",
            "[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:45.080]  He may not be sure.\n",
            "[02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:50.080]  Therefore, purely technically, how to create a feeling of greater confidence?\n",
            "[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  Well, as I am doing now.\n",
            "[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:58.080]  This is slowing down the tempo of speech and lowering the intonation at the end of the phrase.\n",
            "[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.080]  Well, compare.\n",
            "[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.080]  Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail.\n",
            "[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:05.080]  Or, Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail.\n",
            "[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:11.080]  I will call exactly in order to prepare an offer for your company.\n",
            "[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:13.080]  We are slowing down.\n",
            "[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.080]  Again, I am a little impatient.\n",
            "[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:16.080]  Slow down.\n",
            "[02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.080]  Pay attention to this.\n",
            "[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.080]  It didn't work out in a specific conversation.\n",
            "[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:21.080]  I still drove.\n",
            "[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:23.080]  It's okay.\n",
            "[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.080]  In the next conversation, we pay attention again.\n",
            "[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.080]  We are slowing down.\n",
            "[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:31.080]  Remember, it is impossible to learn how to throw the ball at the same time, far and wide.\n",
            "[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.080]  We apply the skills.\n",
            "[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.080]  It's okay.\n",
            "[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:35.080]  When the text is for you.\n",
            "[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:38.080]  When the text is not new for you.\n",
            "[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.080]  Well, this text is just an example.\n",
            "[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.080]  It's not that you literally need to read it.\n",
            "[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.080]  You can rework it somehow for yourself, for your style, for your understanding.\n",
            "[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:54.080]  But I literally wrote this text last night when I was preparing the presentation.\n",
            "[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:57.080]  And for me it is quite new.\n",
            "[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:03.080]  It would take me time for it to sound completely natural for me.\n",
            "[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.080]  When I don't need to focus on the text itself.\n",
            "[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:12.080]  And then it becomes like the cells of my body, my skin, my skin.\n",
            "[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:17.080]  Then the shell is just a shell in which I reflect the message itself.\n",
            "[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  And then it sounds completely calm, completely confident.\n",
            "[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.080]  The appointment of the meeting is already directly with the manager.\n",
            "[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  Peter Petrovich, good afternoon.\n",
            "[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:37.080]  My name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev or Evgeny Yakovlev.\n",
            "[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.080]  I am a business trainer.\n",
            "[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.080]  And your definition of what you are doing.\n",
            "[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:50.080]  Who are you as a person who is engaged in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence and neural networks in organizations?\n",
            "[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:53.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.080]  Again, remember, you can wash your hands.\n",
            "[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:58.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:00.080]  Again.\n",
            "[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.080]  All this.\n",
            "[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:03.080]  All this devil in detail.\n",
            "[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:12.080]  When a formal question, then it seems to be a questioning proposal, but we do not ask in fact.\n",
            "[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.080]  The question would sound like this.\n",
            "[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:18.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.080]  Now I don't know.\n",
            "[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:22.080]  Now I ask.\n",
            "[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.080]  This is what I ask.\n",
            "[02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:29.080]  And then he also begins to think.\n",
            "[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.080]  Do I have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.080]  Or do I not have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:37.080]  It seems that I have just been engaged in some important business.\n",
            "[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.080]  No.\n",
            "[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.080]  We say.\n",
            "[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.080]  I have no doubt.\n",
            "[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.080]  Can you wash your hands?\n",
            "[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:45.080]  Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\n",
            "[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.080]  In some cases, he says no.\n",
            "[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  And this is good.\n",
            "[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:51.080]  Because if he is now irritated or in some business.\n",
            "[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:53.080]  And we will try to discuss.\n",
            "[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.080]  But this will definitely not work.\n",
            "[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080]  And I like it.\n",
            "[02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:58.080]  I always said.\n",
            "[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  Pyotr Petrovich, when will it be more convenient for you for me to call you back?\n",
            "[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.080]  It is psychologically difficult for a person to say never.\n",
            "[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.080]  True.\n",
            "[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:12.080]  If you talk to him politely and respectfully.\n",
            "[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.080]  And he calls for some time.\n",
            "[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:18.080]  And look.\n",
            "[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:20.080]  When he calls for some time.\n",
            "[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:22.080]  Internally, including for himself.\n",
            "[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.080]  He also accepted that it would be convenient for him for me to call him back.\n",
            "[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:27.080]  That he has something to do with it.\n",
            "[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:30.080]  It sounds as if we are hypnotizing a person.\n",
            "[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:31.080]  No.\n",
            "[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:32.080]  We are not hypnotizing.\n",
            "[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.080]  But there is such a concept.\n",
            "[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:35.080]  Not direct impressions.\n",
            "[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:38.080]  The field of Erikson hypnosis.\n",
            "[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:42.080]  These are some very soft.\n",
            "[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:45.080]  Such very touching things.\n",
            "[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.080]  As if they are shards.\n",
            "[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.080]  You know.\n",
            "[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.080]  When I was not the first to study Erikson hypnosis.\n",
            "[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:55.080]  It suddenly came to me.\n",
            "[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:56.080]  Whether we want it or not.\n",
            "[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:59.080]  We do these indirect impressions all the time.\n",
            "[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.080]  And receive.\n",
            "[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:01.080]  And again.\n",
            "[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:03.080]  There is no question of doing it or not.\n",
            "[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:07.080]  We all do it.\n",
            "[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:11.080]  Just notice what kind of impressions we make unnecessary.\n",
            "[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:14.080]  Unnecessary.\n",
            "[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:17.080]  And it is better to avoid some wrong impressions.\n",
            "[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:19.080]  Our own children.\n",
            "[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.080]  Or our business potential partners.\n",
            "[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:25.080]  And rely on some reasonable impressions.\n",
            "[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  Because if I tell him with a slightly different intonation.\n",
            "[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:33.080]  Do you have the opportunity to speak now?\n",
            "[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.080]  I instill in him that I am not sure of something.\n",
            "[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.080]  And you don't have to deal with me.\n",
            "[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.080]  If I tell him.\n",
            "[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:43.080]  Do you have the opportunity to speak now?\n",
            "[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:44.080]  A small emphasis.\n",
            "[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:45.080]  Do you hear again?\n",

            "[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:47.080]  Do you have?\n",
            "[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:49.080]  You can nod a little bit at this point.\n",
            "[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.080]  Even if he doesn't see you.\n",
            "[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.080]  Do you have the opportunity to speak now?\n",
            "[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:54.080]  Do you hear the warm voice?\n",
            "[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:55.080]  You don't hear, right?\n",
            "[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.080]  On equal terms, right from the intonation of the formal question.\n",
            "[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.080]  Warm.\n",
            "[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:04.080]  We make this small, unclear hint to a person.\n",
            "[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.080]  That he now has the opportunity to speak.\n",

            "[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.080]  When a person says yes.\n",
            "[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:10.080]  We say.\n",

            "[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:13.080]  I'm calling to set up a business meeting.\n",
            "[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.080]  Its goal is to find out if it is possible to apply artificial intelligence in your company.\n",

            "[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:33.080]  You can speak more broadly.\n",
            "[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:41.080]  Because you heard that in the example that Dmitry spoke, he spoke more broadly.\n",
            "[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:46.080]  There was such a clarification that, in fact, did not take much time.\n",
            "[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:51.080]  But there was every phrase clear, clear, interchangeable.\n",

            "[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.080]  And it sounded very convincing and very logical.\n",
            "[02:17:55.080 --> 02:18:00.080]  Please, you can, as in the example that Dmitry quoted.\n",
            "[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:07.080]  And you can try it short and so and so.\n",
            "[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:11.080]  But the most important thing is the goal of your call.\n",
            "[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:15.080]  The goal of the call itself is to set up a meeting.\n",

            "[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.080]  The goal of the meeting itself.\n",
            "[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:25.080]  The meeting can be online.\n",

            "[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:33.080]  Its goal is to find out.\n",
            "[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:35.080]  Well, actually, you are talking.\n",
            "[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:39.080]  Be sure to benefit.\n",
            "[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.080]  Not that you want to offer them something.\n",
            "[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.080]  There must be some benefit for them, for their companies.\n",
            "[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:49.080]  And the following.\n",
            "[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:52.080]  You mean time.\n",
            "[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:56.080]  There is the best book on cold calls that I know.\n",

            "[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:10.080]  The best book I've ever read on this topic.\n",
            "[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:15.080]  So, from what Steven Schiffman offers, I don't use two thirds.\n",
            "[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.080]  I use one third.\n",
            "[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:18.080]  And thanks to this third.\n",
            "[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.080]  I really made a lot of money.\n",
            "[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:30.080]  So, one of the points that Steven Schiffman does not recommend is to talk about the duration of the meeting.\n",
            "[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:35.080]  Well, as if this is some kind of restriction in which we drive ourselves in advance.\n",
            "[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.080]  I use 10-15 minutes.\n",
            "[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.080]  This is possible.\n",
            "[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.080]  15-20 minutes.\n",
            "[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  This is possible.\n",
            "[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.080]  Why does it work?\n",
            "[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.080]  Clearness.\n",
            "[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.080]  Additional clarity.\n",
            "[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.080]  When the person understands what we offer, what he agrees on.\n",
            "[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.080]  It removes additional stress from him.\n",
            "[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:56.080]  That is, any choice has its pros and cons.\n",
            "[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.080]  You can do it your own way.\n",
            "[02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:03.080]  But I know for sure that 10-15 minutes was really enough for my meeting, and with an eye-to-eye approach, with a date.\n",
            "[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:11.080]  With an explanation of all the issues.\n",
            "[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:15.080]  And with the fact that I said goodbye to him, briefly telling him that I can do something for him that I cannot, and that I am not afraid of what happens.\n",
            "[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:20.480]  I can do something for him that I can't, and they agreed that I would send him a commercial offer.\n",
            "[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:33.680]  Very often, when a person is attracted, time has passed, 15 minutes have passed, I have always reminded that Petr Petrovich, we agreed here 15 minutes, now 15 minutes is nothing.\n",
            "[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:41.680]  A person, when he is attracted, said nothing, and could sit for an hour and a half, but this is his choice, if we both have time, why not.\n",
            "[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:53.140]  So it's possible, so it's possible, this is a modification of opportunity, this is an allegation to inattention, that the meeting takes 15-20 minutes, it's nonsense, it's not much, it's possible.\n",
            "[02:20:53.140 --> 02:21:00.480]  Psychologically and logically, it's easier to say yes to it.\n",
            "[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:04.860]  I just wanted to say «In fact, weockey is difficult»\n",
            "[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:10.820]  What we talked about. If it was possible to agree on a meeting, but not with the Director, you will remember Nikolai Nikolaevich, if you like everything and you want to use AI technology,\n",
            "[02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:11.660]  if it is possible, it is possible.\n",
            "[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:17.120]  someone with whom it will be necessary to agree on this decision if there is he says there is a director of the film director\n",

            "[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:34.160]  time, namely in a cold contact, I definitely did not say everything that can be said on this topic the skeleton is the\n",
            "[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:41.780]  main thing that in two and a half hours it was very important to talk to you and give a presentation in\n",
            "[02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:49.480]  full volume with us then completely what I thought it was possible to start in this webinar the technique of\n",
            "[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:54.920]  cold calls what we start the meeting with what we take the first part of the meeting is not cold\n",
            "[02:21:54.920 --> 02:22:00.800]  and the technique of the funnel of questions what questions we ask when the orientation interest has already become clear\n",

            "[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:09.840]  a person was ready to pay for this value with the money it costs it will\n",

            "[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:43.120]  The idea is that we see what works for some professionals, for some people, and pay attention to the nuances, to the details.\n",
            "[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:46.120]  Where is the intonation, where is the pause, the expression of the face?\n",
            "[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:50.120]  Most often, people themselves do not realize why it is effective.\n",
            "[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:59.120]  We notice it, and then we can reproduce it ourselves and teach other people.\n",

            "[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:25.120]  In any case, I gave you all our today's webinar with things that I really did for 15 years, in very different contexts, in very different cities, and they work.\n",
            "[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:28.120]  I think they will work exactly the same for you.\n",

            "[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:39.120]  I said, on equal terms, directly with the intonation of the formal question, that is, without any doubt and with sincere warmth.\n",

But when I started selling, I faced a new professional area for myself. Really sales. And there I was incompetent. And, well, it's scary that people will see it. It's unpleasant. Why am I talking about it so importantly? Because, well, friends, this is the first thing to deal with it somehow. To cope with it and overcome it. And this is absolutely true. This is possible. Even for a deep introvert and a deep melancholic like me. In order to cope with it and overcome it, you need to notice it first. The unnamed does not exist. But to tell yourself that I'm scared. This is normal. This does not prevent me from selling at all.\n",

In my business, acupuncture, the main thing was to understand whether the births were normal or there was some kind of pathology. And if the births are normal, then remove your hands, do not interfere in them. Well, if the births are somehow pathological, then interfere competently. And the truth was the main thing. Well, for those who sell their services, who are professionals in some field, and these services need to be sold. This turns out to be the second profession. The most important thing is to make contacts, to talk to people. The quality of how you do it. Well, look, it's not that it doesn't matter. But here is the fundamental thing to allow yourself to do it badly. This is the most fundamental thing. I insist on this. Because so far, while you will think. Well, Evgeny said so many different things that need to be taken into account. Well, how? I will call somehow and I will not take into account something. I get confused. It will not be good enough. To hell with it. I specifically sat down when we talked to Dmitry about the preparation of this webinar. And I wrote a few points on two pages about what to talk about. And then I realized that quite a lot of things did not fit there, which I give in my training in sales trainings. Why? I even did it unconsciously. I highlighted some of the most important things. The rest, like meat on bones, has grown. So, one of the main things is to notice this fear in yourself and respond to these fears. You don't need to be perfect. You don't need to be perfect.

If we, God forbid, tried to deceive a person, we are not great actors, it is clear in the eyes. But in the same way, it is clear to us when we turn to a person to make him feel good. So, the mission in the world of the enemy is some kind of wording that we say inside ourselves, for ourselves, and we can say it out loud to a person during a conversation. The essence of this phrase is that my goal is for you to feel good with my participation, with me.

            "Text: Look, there are only four communication strategies. I'll open it now. It is also worth paying attention to when we talk. The first strategy is passive. All these strategies came to us from the animal world. Except for the confident one. When two cobras meet at a dog wedding, one of them can lie on his back and put his throat. Just don't hit his head. Or squeeze his tail and run away. Or run past a dog wedding. It's all bad, it's insidious. I'll go to the library and read books. Passive strategy is from below. This is the state when we at least a little bit at the moment of the conversation we feel like a beggar who tears off a big important uncle or a seriously busy aunt from her real affairs. And then someone begs to pay attention to us. And again, it's okay if you hear it from yourself. And you will definitely hear it at some point. The fact is that the passive strategy is from below. Such an insecure one from below. My dear. And confident communication, the intonation of confident communication, the look of confident communication, and so on. I set myself. I learned this in steps. And this is only through practice, only through training. And therefore, on the first contacts, on the first steps, remember, I said, allow yourself to be imperfect. You have no goal to do everything right. The goal is just to do it at least. Once. This is completely normal. In any area. And including in the field of cold contacts and meetings. Therefore, just notice. The voice trembled. Somehow they began to twist something in their hands. These which I have now sound. I'm worried. I think about how to fit a large volume, to give you some live pulse beat, which is on sale, which I really like, and which is true, some things that work. And at the same time, I remember that we are now with you two and a half hours. And I'm a little worried now and I'm worried to take all this into account. And this excitement is expressed in the fact that I can echo, I can speak in a hurry. And when I notice it, then I can somehow deal with it. Or wave your hand. Okay, let's admit my mistakes now. It's okay, the point is more important. Don't get distracted, Zhenya. Do as it turns out. Or I can pay attention to echo less, relax. And in any case, the intonation from below is very characteristic. Piotr Petrovich, tell me, what is it related to that is important for you? Well, I'm exaggerating now, it's clear. Aggressive. Aggressive strategy is when Kobel starts to attack, try to tear the throat and so on. And here is an interesting thing. Aggressive behavior strategy also refers to unconfident behavior. Super confidence is a mask of uncertainty. And this happens, well, less often, of course, but it also happens when you suddenly notice that you start to communicate with the interlocutor from above. It's a little bit like you're talking to him as a school teacher. I suppose that in your sales this can also sometimes occur, because the area for a person is most likely completely new and unfamiliar. And he can be rude, because he is a serious person, he is very professional in his field, but he encounters what he does not know, but you know. And he can involuntarily find out his ignorance, and we, also out of fear, can start to dictate something to him. And here, too, it is very important, and it is not confidence, in fact. It is just in this situation that it is important to notice it in the position of equals. Because even if we will dictate something from the position of a school teacher to the head, he will remember it later, he will have unpleasant associations. We correct ourselves. It's okay. It's important to notice it and correct it at the moment. But manipulative is when we start to cheat somehow. When a dog comes to us, we start to look at him with devoted, devoted eyes. The owner will be a bastard if you do not feed him. Friends, in sales, I am not going to teach you some manipulative behavior strategy, deception, bluff. Practical psychology is the psychology of influence. We are learning how to influence the interlocutor, but it is influenced by an ethical purpose. What is active ethical sales? It is to buy. In this case, he did not plan to buy the implementation of the artificial intelligence in his organization. He did not have such thoughts. But he bought and did not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he addresses you again and recommends you to his acquaintances. But initially, this is what he did not plan. Or a person planned to buy something for less money. And he bought more or for more money and does not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he is happy to recommend you to his acquaintances. He addresses you again.

When a person can be status. And when you start working in your profession. For example, when I started working as a business coach, I perceived my status and the status as the head of the organization as very different. Because he is in his profession already firmly standing on his feet. And I am a novice business coach. He earns serious money. He earns serious money. This is now I suspect that at least in some cases I as a psychologist and business coach can earn on average and more than many of the managers with whom I talk. With whom I sell my services. But at the beginning of my activity there is no. Many years are not the first. And then I was working and it is natural. And here it was important to remind myself that I am not his subordinate. Yes, he is an important person in his organization, but I am outside his hierarchy. And in any case, I can recognize his status, his merits, respect him as a person, as a person and show this respect in our conversation.

And then, indeed, either out of fear of being aggressive, not to act at all, not to get in touch. Well, out of fear of being insolent. Well, to be ashamed of it. Or with this. Or to do something with it. And then the fourth component of confident appeal. If we add sincerity to our activity. Remember now what and how Dmitry says in this record. Sincereness, openness, kindness, warmth, care for the interlocutor. Then it will be perceived as confidence. The fourth component, the fifth element, remember there. The fourth component is warmth.

Again, now the most important thing to pay attention to is the correspondence with these four things. But I can't help but say it. Dmitry is doing the so-called program setting.

And out of this confusion, a person usually comes out. In such a way that he offers to tell something to me. He says, Evgeny, well, tell me about your proposal. Well, you can't, it's impossible. If you haven't asked the person, it's in vain to offer him something, to tell him. It will be missed, it will not be for him. Therefore, I always take initiative into my own hands. And I say, Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask you a few questions? Let it be. After the 24th year, they always say yes. There was not a single case in my practice, well, in real meetings, if we had already agreed on a meeting about sales, that a person would say no to me. Again, do you hear how these four criteria sound? Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask him a few questions? And the setting of the program. And the second thing that sounded great here in this excerpt is that Dmitry gives the opportunity to the interlocutor to say no. He directly says that we don't know if it will come in handy or not. But if it doesn't come in handy, well, we just won't continue, it's reasonable. And this is a very important thing. Remember, the main fear of the buyer, we said at the very beginning, is the fear of unwanted external subconscious influence. That somehow your teeth will speak to you. And you will spend money, and then you will feel like a fool. So when we speak confidently, and at the same time I specifically at each stage of sales, I just came to the fact that at each stage of sales I am building up this opportunity to say no. At the stage of the offer, I start with the minuses of my offer. At the stage of finding out the needs, we will talk to you about the funnel of questions. And then I will tell you. At some point I will definitely say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that you are simply guided. That is, I tell him again that I'm not trying to sell him now, he needs to make a decision about the purchase now. Or I can say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. I'm not selling you now, and this is very important. This is very relaxing for a person and causes trust. This is just what is now. I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. That is, I'm not selling you now and this is very important.\n",

Because they have a reorganization scheduled. They are going to move. In general, not before that. And I ask them a simple stupid question. Okay, tell me, who do you know? Who would be interested in it? Please, don't neglect. I'm stupid. Without any hope. Just because it needs to be done. I asked them this question. When they refused.

I remembered that I always at the trainings I say that never decide for the client. Never decide for the buyer. And I call. I still remember how they called the manager and said, you know, now there is a crisis. All training programs have been temporarily stopped. But we have now opened a new unit.

Hello, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev. Well, when I called, the first years I said, in general, the last name and surname. Then it became easier to relate to this, the last name and surname. You can do whatever you want. But if you still say the last name, by calling some organization, you give yourself an additional status. Here. Your classes. Well, I said, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev, I am a business trainer. Well, when we were together with our colleague of the company, whom we loudly called the center of practical psychology of information, I said, good afternoon, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev, the center of practical psychology of information. Well, when we parted and I began to represent only myself, I began to simply say that I am a business trainer. Next, what did I say? God, I said, yes, I asked, tell me, who in your company is engaged in personnel training? I was often sent, especially if there is a small company, and there is no special HR there, a person who deals with personnel, I was sent directly to the director, well, or to the HR, which also satisfied me. In your situation, this question, tell me, who is engaged in the introduction of artificial intelligence? Well, an absurd one. Most likely, no one. At the same time, you really need to go, perhaps, to a higher person in the organization. If there is a general director there, then to the general director. Well, why? It is clear that the higher the position of a person in the organization, the more information he has about all departments. Because it is not clear to you yet in which department the technology can work, be required for them. The second is a person who makes decisions. And it was also a revelation for me, although I, in general, was not a naive person, when I encountered in practice once, and not for the first year of my work, I suddenly made this amazing discovery, that you are talking to some one deputy director about how things are going for them and what they need.\n",

Internally, including for himself. He also accepted that it would be convenient for him for me to call him back. That he has something to do with it. It sounds as if we are hypnotizing a person. No. We are not hypnotizing. But there is such a concept. Not direct impressions. The field of Erikson hypnosis. These are some very soft. Such very touching things. As if they are shards. You know. When I was not the first to study Erikson hypnosis. It suddenly came to me. Whether we want it or not. We do these indirect impressions all the time. And receive. And again.

I really made a lot of money. So, one of the points that Steven Schiffman does not recommend is to talk about the duration of the meeting. Well, as if this is some kind of restriction in which we drive ourselves in advance. I use 10-15 minutes. This is possible. 15-20 minutes. This is possible. Why does it work? Clearness. Additional clarity. When the person understands what we offer, what he agrees on. It removes additional stress from him. That is, any choice has its pros and cons. You can do it your own way. But I know for sure that 10-15 minutes was really enough for my meeting, and with an eye-to-eye approach, with a date. With an explanation of all the issues. And with the fact that I said goodbye to him, briefly telling him that I can do something for him that I cannot, and that I am not afraid of what happens. I can do something for him that I can't, and they agreed that I would send him a commercial offer. Very often, when a person is attracted, time has passed, 15 minutes have passed, I have always reminded that Petr Petrovich, we agreed here 15 minutes, now 15 minutes is nothing. A person, when he is attracted, said nothing, and could sit for an hour and a half, but this is his choice, if we both have time, why not. So it's possible, so it's possible, this is a modification of opportunity, this is an allegation to inattention, that the meeting takes 15-20 minutes, it's nonsense, it's not much, it's possible.

The very first collision is with fear, with your own fear.\\nSo, now I'll try how to list it, it's probably better here, it will still work out. Yes.\\nAnd please write in the chat, what do you think, what is the main fear of the seller of their services?\\nWell, your fear, perhaps, as you imagine, when you come across the fact that somehow you need to call the company,\\nsomehow meet, offer.\\nAnd today, today, let's say, after our meeting,\\nafter our webinar,\\nwhen you will be afraid, and you will be afraid if you are people, and this is absolutely normal,\\nthen what will you be afraid of? This is one question.\\nAnd if you have a fantasy, what is the main fear of the buyer, well, in contact, when you talk to him,\\nin general, any buyer, your main fear, when they try to sell something to you,\\nwhat you are not specifically asking for,\\nor to sell.\\nPlease write in the chat, the main fear of the seller and the main fear of the buyer, what do you think?\\nYes, Anna, the buyer's fear that he will be deceived.\\nAlexander, not knowing the answer to some, apparently, simple question for the buyer,\\nto get a refusal.\\nFear of refusal, that they will not buy.\\nSo, the chat does not work, apparently, to write here.\\nFear of encountering many negative emotions from the buyer.\\nFear that they will impose.\\nYes, I don't like cold calls.\\nListen, I don't always want to communicate at all.\\nMe too, yes.\\nThis is a very typical thing, often for a good professional.\\nThat some unnecessary thing falls, fear of refusal.\\nYes, yes, absolutely right.\\nLook, this is really so.\\nThe main fear of the seller is not even just a refusal, but a fear of rejection.\\nThe fact is that we are afraid that we will be told no, in fact, on our offer.\\nBut the psyche.\\n\\n## Section 1: The Experience of Shame\\nBut the human psyche is so arranged that when we are told no to some of our completely specific offers, we can perceive it as if we are totally rejected as a person, completely. Moreover, this may not be realized, but this is a very unpleasant experience. In fact, we are talking about the experience of shame.\\n\\n## Section 2: Understanding Shame\\nWhat is shame? Shame is the horror of rejection. That I will not just do something not quite successfully or unsuccessfully, but I will do something that will make people realize that I am bad. People will think, decide that I am some kind of unworthy, bad. And all significant people will also find out about this and turn away from me, and my social status will fall below the plinth. I will be rejected. Shame is the horror of the catastrophic collapse of social status. And shame is such a painful, so unpleasant experience, that people usually do not even realize it. It is just so unpleasant to touch this feeling that it is easier not to do anything at all, which can cause my contact with this experience.\\n\\n## Section 3: Procrastination and Fear of Rejection\\nAnd then you know what occurs? Procrastination. This horror of rejection, fear of rejection, meeting with rejection, and therefore with shame, is one of the main reasons for procrastination. Why am I rejected? Why am I rejected? It seems that I have even set a plan for myself. Where will I call? Who will I talk to? How many calls do I need in a week? And everything is so reasonable. But for some reason I postpone and delay all this. This is the truth. And the time comes, and it is disgusting. Well, disgusting. I don't want to. I don't want to.\\n\\n## Section 4: Fear of Incompetence\\nLook, what does it have to do with? Conflict with your incompetence. Pa-pam. Truth. You all now have your own profession. In which you are competent. Well, let's say I was a competent acupuncturist-gynecologist. I worked for seven years. I was really well prepared. And I operated. And I was a wonderful specialist. But when I started selling, I faced a new professional area for myself. Really sales. And there I was incompetent. And, well, it's scary that people will see it. It's unpleasant. Why am I talking about it so importantly? Because, well, friends, this is the first thing to deal with it somehow. To cope with it and overcome it. And this is absolutely true. This is possible. Even for a deep introvert and a deep melancholic like me. In order to cope with it and overcome it, you need to notice it first. The unnamed does not exist. But to tell yourself that I'm scared. This is normal. This does not prevent me from selling at all.\\n\\n## Section 5: The Main Thing in Business\\nThere is such a question. What is the main thing in the business? In any business. What is the main thing in the business? Let's say when I was an acupuncturist. In my business, acupuncture, the main thing was to understand whether the births were normal or there was some kind of pathology. And if the births are normal, then remove your hands, do not interfere in them. Well, if the births are somehow pathological, then interfere competently. And the truth was the main thing. Well, for those who sell their services, who are professionals in some field, and these services need to be sold. This turns out to be the second profession. The most important thing is to make contacts, to talk to people. The quality of how you do it. Well, look, it's not that it doesn't matter. But here is the fundamental thing to allow yourself to do it badly. This is the most fundamental thing. I insist on this. Because so far, while you will think. Well, Evgeny said so many different things that need to be taken into account. Well, how? I will call somehow and I will not take into account something. I get confused. It will not be good enough. To hell with it. I specifically sat down when we talked to Dmitry about the preparation of this webinar. And I wrote a few points on two pages about what to talk about. And then I realized that quite a lot of things did not fit there, which I give in my training in sales trainings. Why? I even did it unconsciously. I highlighted some of the most important things. The rest, like meat on bones, has grown. So, one of the main things is to notice this fear in yourself and respond to these fears. You don't need to be perfect. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to do it.\\n\\n## Section 6: Acting Imperfectly\\nEven if you call and are not the person making the decision. Even if you don't get to the director of some company. Even if you call any department, the accountant, and tell some accountant, I'm here about this artificial intelligence for your company. I don't know what it's called. This is already good. Already in some cases, this random accountant will somehow get interested and say, I don't understand anything about this. Let me better connect you with the director. That is, the most important thing is to do it. And the most important thing is to act, allowing yourself to be imperfect. Allow yourself to fail. Allow yourself to get into trouble. This is the main thing. Against the background of this activity, everything else will grow and happen. True. Yes.\\n\\n## Section 7: Fear of Being a Beggar\\nWell, the main fear of the buyer is absolutely correct. They wrote about the fear of undesirable external influence. That's how a fortune teller came to the station, and then you were left without earrings. And both are very well filmed by the next good thing. It was a direct discovery for me. The mission in the world of the client. This is called. Look, when I just start selling, and even when I sell for some time, what is very much in the way of what I meet and what you most likely will meet one way or another, is the feeling of being a beggar. This is the feeling that I am imposing myself. After all, people work normally without me. They don't come to me. And I'm calling. I distract. Listen, I'm not exaggerating now. These thoughts, in fact, they come to me. They will arise in you. That I distract people from their work. I interfere with their working life. But what right do I have? And I clearly remember that I had a moment when I once, from my work as a gynecologist.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Reflection on Professional Experience\\nText: an experienced professional, a professional, who had a job and worked as a gynecologist, was told that he or she was a good person. And I understood that these are good people.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of Respect and Learning to Sell\\nText: Those who meet, who greet, who use the respect of others, obviously. And I've already learned to sell. And I've been deprived of it, because I've been free from work during the evenings and weekends. I have already earned three times more in sales than at my main job. And there was such a situation that money was important for the family.\\n\\n## Section 3: The Feeling of Being a Professional Beggar\\nText: were important and I chose, but I remember this moment, I am congratulated that there is a change in profession, but I clearly have this feeling that I have become a professional beggar, the truth is how much this position of a person who calls, look, the fact is that any active sale is always a request, it is a proposal, but it is always a request, talk to me, give me time to take my words seriously and if you ask for something associated with some kind of position of humiliation, then it will be phony, but this is the most important thing in life, it is necessary to ask for something, but for example, there is a famous one, do not believe do not be afraid do not ask, but I remind you that these are the laws of the zone, the laws of the zone are the laws of survival, psychologists have a good saying that it is good to survive, it is bad for life to ask, just as to say no, just as to say that you want and that you do not want people at all, this is the most important social skill, but who need to learn by themselves and teach their children, this is actually normal, this is not a shame.\\n\\n## Section 4: Learning Sales Techniques and Ethical Approach\\nText: And for me, the turning point here was when I visited at the beginning of the 2000s at the training of Sergey Azimov, a very good sales coach, and he said a very simple thing that the deal will only take place if it is beneficial to both sides. Listen, don't even worry, we are not great manipulators. I have been professionally engaged in practical psychology for 21 years, and practical psychology is the psychology of influence, it is about how to influence yourself and other people, practical psychology is not engaged in anything else. So I can't do that. Well, I can't do that. Well, I can't do that. In doing so, I need to hypnotize a certain person so that he does what he really does not need. What we are studying today and on the 28th of May and will be learning is how to talk to a person well-meaningly, competently, to remove his thorns so that he is not a hedgehog. But this is a conversation of two normal, worthy people who do not lie, do not bluff. that only honest, ethical sales are possible. Otherwise, they just won't buy from us. If we, God forbid, tried to deceive a person, we are not great actors, it is clear in the eyes. But in the same way, it is clear to us when we turn to a person to make him feel good. So, the mission in the world of the enemy is some kind of wording that we say inside ourselves, for ourselves, and we can say it out loud to a person during a conversation. The essence of this phrase is that my goal is for you to feel good with my participation, with me. And the phrase that I have been using for many years in sales, in sales, in cold calls, when I call, well, usually we go through a secretary, a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, who is a guard, and I feel a sense of pride. I feel proud of being a director. Today we will analyze these techniques, how to talk to a secretary and how to talk to a person who makes decisions, with the headperson. Of course, it is better to try to rise to the highest person in the organization who can make decisions. But the phrase that I formulated. Well, first of all, I say it directly. When I introduced myself, Petr Petrovich, when we had a meeting, we were talking about how we could double this and this. And this is what I said. And this is what I said. And this is what I said. And this is what I said. This is what I said. And this is what I said. And this is what I said. And this is what I said. And this is what we need to do. And this is what we need to do.\\n\\n## Section 5: Approaching Business Meetings and Setting Goals\\nText: My name is Denis Yakovlev, I am a business coach. And then I say to him, Petr Petrovich, I'm calling to set up a business meeting. That is, I immediately talk about the goal. I do not command, I do not command. The goal of the call. And then the goal of the meeting. Its goal is to find out what we can be interesting and useful for you. Well, or what I can be interesting and useful for you. If I hear that by voice the person at the end of the cable is more official, then I speak in a more official tone. If he speaks more reluctantly, more fun, somehow more I can rephrase a little and say, Petr Petrovich, I'm calling to set up a business meeting. Its goal is to find out what I can be interesting and useful for you at all. Well, I agree with the national state. There may be variations, but this is the essence.\\n\\n## Section 6: Overcoming Fear and Imperfection in Business\\nText: My goal is not to sell this. And this is also a fundamental thing. The first thing is to notice your fear. And allow yourself to be imperfect. And understand what is the main thing in the business. The main thing is not to be perfect at all. Make contacts, fail, get rejections. But do it. And the second is with what inner message to enter into these contacts. What is it? My goal at this moment is not to sell outsourcing, not to sell the creation of a neural network of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Section 7: Personal Experience and Meeting with Middle-Class Leaders\\nText: A few years ago, there was the biggest sale in my life, when I sold one of my training days for 200,000 pure rubles. Plus, I was paid a flight from Arkhangelsk, where I live, to Moscow and back, plus 6% tax. It was all official. But I never received 200,000 rubles for a training day before or after. And at first I met with the leaders of the middle class in the organization. You will also have this. It is necessary in some cases that first you meet not with the first person, even when you try. And this is a completely normal thing. And we talked to them.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Setting the Stage\\nText: Please let's think step by step: Think about which sections in the text you can recognise and what meaningful title you can give to each section. Next, write your answer across the previous answer in order:\\n\\n## Section 2: Starting the Meeting\\nTitle: Setting the Context\\nText: I asked them. That's what we're going to start with today. And on the 28th, we will continue the funnel of questions. That's all.\\n\\n## Section 3: Presenting the Offer\\nTitle: Being Honest and Transparent\\nText: I did it. I put them to myself. I immediately told them what I can't give them, and what I can give. Well, also honestly, I always start my offer with the minuses of my offer. When I asked a person, I immediately said no. What I won't give him. First of all, it's honest. Secondly, it sharply increases my confidence. And then I say how I can be useful to him and his organization.\\n\\n## Section 4: Meeting with the Decision Maker\\nTitle: The Final Decision\\nText: But the next level was a meeting with a person who accepts, of course, the final decision about the training of the executive director. And I knew that on this day he would meet with several other trainers of other organizations. And he will choose. I come in advance. I prepared a presentation. And I feel that I am worried. I start shaking. Although, in fact, I am a professional salesman. But you remember that I didn't go anywhere with the donkeys. I stay with the donkeys. I have the same character. I just learned something. And moreover, those same middle-class managers walk past me in the office. They are sick for me. They are worried. And they say, Evgeny, have you prepared a presentation? Evgeny, you have a good presentation. Evgeny, you need to sell yourself. I feel that I'm starting to shake. And I feel that I'm starting to worry very much. That very fear. To discover your incompetence. To face my shame. And what do I do? Fortunately, I know what we are talking about now. I literally apply this technique that we are talking about now. I remind myself that the goal of this meeting is not to sell him my training. The goal of this meeting is to find out what I can be interesting and useful for them at all. I don't have any other goal at this stage. This is the real goal of this stage. We are allies. I calm down. I don't go to a person on the other side of the barricade. Or as a beggar, as a beggar. Buy it from me. I go as a person who understands something about his product. And who can ask questions. So that we can figure it out together and understand together. Whether he needs it or not. If he needs it, what can I give him? What can't I give him? I know for sure that if I find out that I don't need it, I will be the first to tell him about it. And then I calm down very much. I go in.\\n\\n## Section 5: Making a Connection\\nTitle: Falling in Love with Every Bend\\nText: And there is one more thing. I call it to fall in love with every bend. This is Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky. There is such an image in the Brothers Karamazovs. Daddy Karamazov. A nasty guy. A traitor, a fraud. He is killed at the beginning of the novel. But he has time to give a recipe for temptation. He says that in any woman, even in a fool, there is at least one beautiful bend. This bend must be looked at and loved with all my heart. She will feel that a great, bright feeling is coming from you. And she is yours. Friends, the truth works regardless of gender and age. You get in touch with a person even only by phone. You hear his voice. You imagine something good about this person, about his voice. In a video conference, in Zoom, you see a person. You find something that you really like in him. I go into the hall where the meeting is. And I see a gray man. Maybe a little older than me. I see gray, frayed hair. Ironic eyes. And I focus on the fact that I like that we are about the same age. His gray hair. That we are people who have some kind of life experience. I like that he has an ironic expression in his tired eyes. That he is diligent. That he has a sense of humor. That this is not against me. That this is just a smart person. And I like it. And we start talking to him. And everything happened. They did not bargain. They did not bargain. For them it turned out to be more important the trust that arose as a result of the meeting. I came not like the one who wants to tell them something. I came as a person who ... I am here for you. And I really like the phrase that Sergey Azimov says. The highest goal of sales should be noble. And he makes his hands like this. True. The highest goal of sales should be noble.\\n\\n## Section 6: Crafting Effective Phrases\\nTitle: Practical Examples\\nText: Now I will offer you to write any phrase within two minutes. Write any phrase of this kind for addressing your potential client. When you will, let's say, promote your services, offer the introduction of artificial intelligence into the organization. Or maybe your current boss, if he is. A subordinate, a spouse, any person. A phrase that can really come in handy for you in your real life. Below are examples of such phrases. For example, when I train business representatives, you understand that if they call and say to some organization, I want to offer you our equipment. Listen, well, send an offer by email. But in fact, we are already buying equipment from our suppliers. We are not interested in you. This is a completely different thing. When we are looking for the opportunity for you to buy equipment in more interesting conditions for you than now. I want you to be more interesting than now. With us. The second phrase, the second example is when many years ago, the first time my family and I came to Turkey. I didn't know anything about these water parks. I dived into this pipe right in my glasses. And then, of course, I didn't find glasses in the pool in this big one. And I went to the pharmacy in Khmer. For the first time abroad, in general, in life, a Soviet person, well, for education. And I think that I need to buy something the cheapest. Because I pay with currency. And already in Russia I will buy a normal one. And the Turk, through the translator, does not sell so competently that I compliment him. I tell him. You know. You sell very competently. To which the Turk, outraged, through the translator, answers me. I don't sell you. I want the right to really please you. This shocked me so much. And the right has long been broken. Bought, broken and forgotten. But listen. It's been 15 years. 15 years have passed. I remember the phrase. I don't sell you this.\\n\\n## Section 1: The Situation\\nText: During the crisis, in my opinion, in 2008, the head accountant turned to me. Her predecessor resigned. My client worked as the deputy head accountant for many years. Accordingly, she was promoted. But the salary was left the same. And she works for a month, two, three. She has as many as three bosses. No one asks her about raising the salary. She gets, processes a huge amount of work. Gets, in general, quite ridiculous money. And she reasonably thinks that when she turns to the bosses, they will tell her. Crisis. No money. And she came to me. How to negotiate the salary.\\n\\n## Section 2: The Mission\\nText: The mission in the world of the enemy. We formulated this with her. My goal is for you to have an absolutely competent head accountant. But she is really competent. She has worked in this company for many years. Knows everything thoroughly. And whom you can fully trust. And who knows that he receives a fair and decent salary. And look at this formulation. Whatever you say to her. There is no budget. No opportunities. Difficult situation. But we will think. Very calm repetition of this phrase.\\n\\n## Section 3: Similar Phrases\\nText: Friends. And now two minutes. Think. Write some similar phrase. Maybe, as you could say in your future sales, when you will call or meet potential customers of your services. Maybe from some area of personal life. Write, please, where the question mark. Maybe in your technology sector. Maybe at a business center. Exhibits your skills and capabilities. Would you be willing to focus on the job of general providing the kind... You would not be willing to give surgery. Well, please be contains. You would do your best. And we are in.\\n\\n## Section 4: The Goal\\nText: Yes, I want to help simplify your technical process. Yes, friends, the only thing is to be very careful with the word I want. At the moment when we play the role of sellers, the word I want is better forgotten. True, at the level of subconsciousness, it works a little against us. No one cares what you want. My goal is better.\\n\\n## Section 5: Solving Problems\\nText: Yes. Yes. Yes. I have no goal to sell, I am looking for an opportunity to improve your work process with the help of artificial intelligence. Yes, very good. My proposal will help to reduce waste. Yes, my goal, we will try to solve this annoying problem with the help. I want your business to bring you pleasure without headaches. Yes, yes. My goal, I do not sell neural networks.

Yes. Yes.\\n\\n## Section 6: Artificial Intelligence Consultant\\nText: Do you support an intelligence consultant? Do you support an artificial intelligence consultant? Yes. ... Yes. Yes. Yes, everything you wrote is about this issue. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.\\n\\n## Section 7: Speaking Confidently\\nText: In reality, this is not an imitation. When you understand this, when it has become your flesh and blood, then the main fear of the seller, which we talked about, is removed, at least to a great extent. And now, look, a confident appeal. There are four... Yes, Ruslan raised his hand. I don't know what it means. Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Yes, friends, unfortunately... Unfortunately, I don't understand what it means. I don't know what to write. There... Yes, the one here where the question and the answer are located. Where did you write now? Yes, Vladimir writes, it seems to me when you talk to a potential customer with standard phrases, with template phrases, then it will immediately make you look like a steamer, like such a goal of mine, look when words sound natural to you when they express your thought for people they also sound natural, for example, the truth is, this is such a beaten thing that they have already stopped, as far as I know, speaking in sales training in training that there is 7 percent, in my opinion, now I do not remember exactly 7 percent of the information we get through the content of words there 38 percent of the information we get through intonation pauses intermission paraverbal well, and there is 55 percent we get through generally non-verbal non-verbal gestures mimicry and so on, but in fact, not quite like that, I will not go into detail now, but it is absolutely certain that how to speak blocks what we are talking about if we are talking confidently about what we are talking about if we are talking confidently confidence has light hypnotic effects this is right about what this slide is about now how to speak so that our speech is perceived normally but look all the same common common rule people are mirrors if you are sincere and the words that you use yes of course these are templates but you understand in any case how you will talk to potential buyers it in any case there will be templates just because you can not really with each buyer speak in a new way you can not with each become literally another person and for everyone and invent a new beginning of the conversation is unrealistic it is unrealistic you can not just realize that you have the...\\n\\nNote: The text provided is quite long and contains repetitive phrases. I have included the most relevant sections, but there may be additional sections that can be identified.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Background\\nText: you can say, from what it was translated from Russian, ere стал Chile, left, the meaning of time, something else, but for me, of course, it sounds related to what it is related to, in fact, in its essence, it is rather a literary turn, but from 97 it is scary to say 24 years I have been engaged but 24 years I am engaged in professional sales, I really sell more than once a person did not jerk and did not be alarmed when I normally ask him a question what is it related to that is important for you for me it sounds natural and then it sounds natural for him and here are the turns that you will make which you will use in cold calls at meetings there in the zoom online very important in phone conversations when they are yes they are template they are for you such regular but when each time you fill them with living blood with living content for people, too, this about living blood and living content they do not jerk but if with a mechanical voice to say which is why it is important for you then the check really yearned what is connected with the difference between what is important for you, you feel the difference, you are important to what words I say about this until the tenth\\n\\n## Section 2: Communication Strategies\\nText: Look, there are only four communication strategies. I'll open it now. It is also worth paying attention to when we talk. The first strategy is passive. All these strategies came to us from the animal world. Except for the confident one. When two cobras meet at a dog wedding, one of them can lie on his back and put his throat. Just don't hit his head. Or squeeze his tail and run away. Or run past a dog wedding. It's all bad, it's insidious. I'll go to the library and read books. Passive strategy is from below. This is the state when we at least a little bit at the moment of the conversation we feel like a beggar who tears off a big important uncle or a seriously busy aunt from her real affairs. And then someone begs to pay attention to us. And again, it's okay if you hear it from yourself. And you will definitely hear it at some point. The fact is that the passive strategy is from below. Such an insecure one from below. My dear. And confident communication, the intonation of confident communication, the look of confident communication, and so on. I set myself. I learned this in steps. And this is only through practice, only through training. And therefore, on the first contacts, on the first steps, remember, I said, allow yourself to be imperfect. You have no goal to do everything right. The goal is just to do it at least. Once. This is completely normal. In any area. And including in the field of cold contacts and meetings. Therefore, just notice. The voice trembled. Somehow they began to twist something in their hands. These which I have now sound. I'm worried. I think about how to fit a large volume, to give you some live pulse beat, which is on sale, which I really like, and which is true, some things that work. And at the same time, I remember that we are now with you two and a half hours. And I'm a little worried now and I'm worried to take all this into account. And this excitement is expressed in the fact that I can echo, I can speak in a hurry. And when I notice it, then I can somehow deal with it. Or wave your hand. Okay, let's admit my mistakes now. It's okay, the point is more important. Don't get distracted, Zhenya. Do as it turns out. Or I can pay attention to echo less, relax. And in any case, the intonation from below is very characteristic. Piotr Petrovich, tell me, what is it related to that is important for you? Well, I'm exaggerating now, it's clear. Aggressive. Aggressive strategy is when Kobel starts to attack, try to tear the throat and so on. And here is an interesting thing. Aggressive behavior strategy also refers to unconfident behavior. Super confidence is a mask of uncertainty. And this happens, well, less often, of course, but it also happens when you suddenly notice that you start to communicate with the interlocutor from above. It's a little bit like you're talking to him as a school teacher. I suppose that in your sales this can also sometimes occur, because the area for a person is most likely completely new and unfamiliar. And he can be rude, because he is a serious person, he is very professional in his field, but he encounters what he does not know, but you know. And he can involuntarily find out his ignorance, and we, also out of fear, can start to dictate something to him. And here, too, it is very important, and it is not confidence, in fact. It is just in this situation that it is important to notice it in the position of equals. Because even if we will dictate something from the position of a school teacher to the head, he will remember it later, he will have unpleasant associations. We correct ourselves. It's okay. It's important to notice it and correct it at the moment. But manipulative is when we start to cheat somehow. When a dog comes to us, we start to look at him with devoted, devoted eyes. The owner will be a bastard if you do not feed him. Friends, in sales, I am not going to teach you some manipulative behavior strategy, deception, bluff. Practical psychology is the psychology of influence. We are learning how to influence the interlocutor, but it is influenced by an ethical purpose. What is active ethical sales? It is to buy. In this case, he did not plan to buy the implementation of the artificial intelligence in his organization. He did not have such thoughts. But he bought and did not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he addresses you again and recommends you to his acquaintances. But initially, this is what he did not plan. Or a person planned to buy something for less money. And he bought more or for more money and does not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he is happy to recommend you to his acquaintances. He addresses you again. We are talking about such sales. And then it is not about manipulation, but about influence.\\n\\n## Section 1: Ethical influence\\nText: Ethical influence, because it is impossible not to influence when we offer our services. This influence should be, as we have already said, when we talk to a person without deception, when we do not lie. Once again, a deal can only be made if it is beneficial to both sides.\\n\\n## Section 2: Intonation and equal terms\\nText: What is confidence? There are four rules. How to make the intonation sound confident? How to make the intonation sound confident? How to make the intonation sound confident? How to make the intonation sound confident? How to make the intonation sound confident? First, we turn to equals. Not from above and not from below. Yes, we turn to equals. When a person can be status. And when you start working in your profession. For example, when I started working as a business coach, I perceived my status and the status as the head of the organization as very different. Because he is in his profession already firmly standing on his feet. And I am a novice business coach. He earns serious money. He earns serious money. This is now I suspect that at least in some cases I as a psychologist and business coach can earn on average and more than many of the managers with whom I talk. With whom I sell my services. But at the beginning of my activity there is no. Many years are not the first. And then I was working and it is natural. And here it was important to remind myself that I am not his subordinate. Yes, he is an important person in his organization, but I am outside his hierarchy. And in any case, I can recognize his status, his merits, respect him as a person, as a person and show this respect in our conversation. But as a person, I am definitely no worse, no lower than him and no better, no higher. Intonation, conversation not from below and not from above, on equal terms. First. Second.\\n\\n## Section 3: Direct proposal and selling a meeting\\nText: We say our proposal directly. We do not lie, we do not go from afar. Because the template that I showed you when I call, I introduce myself to the head, I ask if he has the opportunity now to speak. I ask if he has the opportunity to set up a business meeting. I am selling a meeting now. I am not selling my services. I am selling a meeting, specifically at this stage. Its goal is to find out what I can be interesting and useful for you. The meeting will take 10-15 minutes. Is it possible? Everything. In my case, everything at all. There could really be a couple of typical doubts and objections on the sheet. There were answers to these doubts and objections. I did not have to think at all. I formulated them myself, as we do now. And it was necessary to read them with a living intonation. Why was I happy? Because I knew what to answer. And then, indeed, meetings were appointed. Not in every conversation. My statistics were one conversation out of four or five. You may have a different situation, a different specificity. But it is important to consider and understand your statistics. The main point is that I am addressing a person directly. The fewer objections, the better.\\n\\n## Section 4: Formal question and justifying confidence\\nText: The next is the intonation of a formal question. We have no doubt that this is a formal question. Imagine that you come to visit and ask the hostess, can you wash your hands? You have no doubt that you can wash your hands here. Maybe you can't wash your hands here. Of course you can. This is a formal question. When you call and say your own phrase, I say mine as an example. Petr Petrovich, I am calling to make a business meeting. Its goal is to find out what I can be interesting and useful for you. The meeting will take 10-15 minutes. Is it possible? When you say it is possible, when you say the whole phrase, you have no doubt that the person will treat it normally. And if he is really interested, he will certainly say yes. And now the question that I wrote here. What do you think that the person will treat you normally? That he will not send you with dirty words? What are the reasons that of course he will come to us? Please write your thoughts where there are questions and answers. And how can you justify this to yourself? Why do we have no doubt that the person will certainly come to us for a meeting? Of course, he will answer our questions. Of course, he will agree to a conversation, a meeting, perhaps online, not really now. And what about the questions that we have in the chat? What do we have in the chat? Anna asks a question. What should we talk about next? We will talk about the medical formulations. But in general, I would agree. Look, if we say what can be useful, and I will say that we are engaged in the implementation of artificial intelligence, he is really not interested. Well, such a set of questions. It's just about the same thing, just differently. Because he and you are interested in this, because the topic is interesting for him. We immediately say that the meeting is business. Interesting and useful is everything about a person, his needs, his concerns. We cannot know this in advance, but we hope for the mood. He is interested in everything that can improve his business. Each head has problems in business, he is interested in solving them if possible. Alright. And tell us we have answers for you in comments. If we see what people have problems with which you do. Yes or no. Where you can. Yes, yes, look, I think I'll look at the chat after our lesson and on some questions that I will not answer now during our webinar, I will not have time to read them, I will try to give the answer on the 28th, but now we kind of have no doubt that a person will treat you normally. First, we are based on the fact that I am a normal, adequate person, I am a normal, adequate person myself and my interlocutor is also a normal, adequate person. In fact, we do not know about it. And I really think that any person can be both adequate and inadequate in different situations, and shout, and scandalize, and break down, and so on.\\n\\n## Section 1: Pragmatic Usefulness\\nText: It is pragmatically useful, not because it is true, but pragmatically, that is, for our purpose of normal contact, it is useful to imagine that the person with whom we communicate is definitely a normal, adequate, changeable, decent person.\\n\\n## Section 2: I am OK, you are OK\\nText: And so I talk to them. If I am a normal person and he is a normal person, this is the famous I am OK, you are OK, I am OK, you are OK.\\nI am OK, you are OK.\\nI am OK, you are OK.\\nI am OK, you are OK.\\n\\n## Section 3: Offering Changeable and Adequate Things\\nText: First. And second, what I offer him is also a completely changeable, a completely adequate thing.\\nI do not offer him to introduce artificial intelligence into his enterprise now.\\nNothing but fear.\\nThis offer, if this offer to introduce it at the level of a cold call, cannot be called.\\nIt's too early.\\nOn the contrary.\\nWe do not go away from the fact that at the stage of a cold call what we say looked like some kind of offer already about implementation.\\nNo.\\nWe are now selling him a conversation, a search for an opportunity, whether it will be profitable for him to explore this opportunity.\\nBecause if not, then no.\\nIt's OK.\\nWe are honest.\\nThe market is changing.\\nWe have clarified and if it turns out that no, we will be the first to tell him about it.\\nIf yes, then maybe he will find it interesting and he will want to introduce it.\\nBut so far we do not know.\\nTherefore, what do we sell at the cold call?\\nWe sell a meeting, not artificial intelligence, but a meeting on which to clarify, in fact, maybe it is interesting and useful for him to introduce artificial intelligence into his enterprise.\\nAnd this is completely interchangeable.\\nAnd that's why we have an intonation of a formal question.\\nWe are really an adequate person who is now calling and talking to an adequate person with an adequate purpose for both purposes.\\nOffers perfectly interchangeable things.\\n\\n## Section 4: The Power of Confidence\\nText: And when you know this and do not doubt it, confidence has a light hypnotic effect.\\nThis does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\\nIt does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\\nIt does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\\nIt does not guarantee that you will be able to do it.\\nIt does not guarantee that a person will say yes to you.\\nBut clearly, at times, the intonation of a confident address, this state, the inner message, increases the probability.\\nThis is clear.\\nThis is a statistic that a person reacts to it.\\nYou tell him interchangeable things and he answers interchangeably.\\nWhen we start to speak uncertainly, we start to speak from below, the person, if we ourselves ...\\nHe subconsciously reads that we are not confident in our offer.\\nIf we are not confident in our offer, why should he be confident in it?\\nHe says no.\\n\\n## Section 5: Dmitry's Approach\\nText: And now, with the permission of Dmitry, I will include a recording.\\nI asked him to tell me how he sees a conversation with a potential client.\\nHow does he generally propose to talk?\\nAnd Dmitry ...\\nDmitry dictated some text.\\nWell, usually I speak.\\nUsually I teach to speak like this.\\nAnd I think that Dmitry has already, perhaps, spoken about this with you or will speak.\\nBut now I will turn on his voice so that you listen to the correspondence with these three technical criteria that I have already written.\\nJust a second.\\n\\n## Section 6: Describing the World as It Is\\nText: Well, I don't know how it will turn out, but I hope that everything will be heard well.\\nWhen it comes to a meeting, I usually say that, look, the artificial intelligence is now starting to be used everywhere.\\nAll companies.\\nNow I have not heard of a single company that you have not already used, or I have already thought of you.\\nThat is, the whole market goes there.\\nThis is the same as the Internet 20-30 years ago.\\nDo you hear the intonation?\\nDmitry is now speaking on equal terms.\\nNot from below and not from above.\\nAlthough it seems like he is reporting some information that, perhaps, the interlocutors do not know.\\nBut Dmitry seems to describe the picture of the world as it is.\\nThe world is such.\\nAnd he respects the interlocutor.\\nThis is exactly the position, well, by the methods of exclusion, not from above, not from above.\\nHa, you don't know, now I'll tell you.\\nWell, you understand, the world goes there.\\nOn equal terms, clearly.\\nI am a professional, I inform.\\nPerhaps you know about it yourself.\\nBut in any case, it is so.\\nDmitry speaks directly.\\nAbout the topic of the conversation.\\nNot Yulid.\\nAnd he says, as if with no doubt, that the interlocutor perceives this normally.\\nThat he is certainly ready to hear it and ready to take it into account.\\nLet's listen further.\\n\\n## Section 7: Confidence in Artificial Intelligence\\nText: Now, in the end, there are only companies in the world with the Internet, and there are no companies without the Internet.\\nThe same will now be with the Internet.\\nThis is a similar case.\\nThe same will now be with artificial intelligence.\\nWe have no doubt that this is so.\\nWe are describing the real picture of the world.\\nThe grass is green.\\nThe sky is blue.\\nThe water is wet.\\nThe same with artificial intelligence.\\nThis is confidence.\\nNot a plumb, not a push from above, not a dictation.\\nAccordingly, this is the same with artificial intelligence.\\nAccording to these three things.\\n\\n## Section 8: Removing Shame and Emphasizing Normalcy\\nText: But at the same time, almost no one knows how to apply it.\\nBecause there are no experts.\\nActually, I propose a meeting where I will talk to you.\\nLook what Dmitry is doing now.\\nThis is an amazing thing.\\nBut no one knows how to apply it.\\nHe is now removing the shame.\\nRemember that it is very unpleasant for any person to face his ignorance, his incompetence.\\nVery unpleasant.\\nAnd a person, in order to avoid meeting with this experience, can refuse to meet.\\nAnd what Dmitry said.\\nBut now no one.\\nThat you are exactly in the same position in which everyone else is now.\\nThis is normal.\\nYou are a normal, adequate person.\\nThis is also a message that I am a normal, adequate person who knows about artificial intelligence.\\nAnd you are a normal, adequate person who knows nothing.\\nAnd the mind cannot be applied as artificial intelligence.\\nYou cannot be applied as artificial intelligence in your company.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction\\nText: This is normal. You and I are normal, adequate people. And before we listen to what Dmitry is saying further.\\n\\n## Section 2: Active Engagement\\nText: Now the next slide. Look. If we actively enter the company, not at the invitation. We are active. Activity, in essence, is always aggression. But this is an invasion. We really call a person during his working day. We really switch a person from some of his daily work. And then, indeed, either out of fear of being aggressive, not to act at all, not to get in touch. Well, out of fear of being insolent. Well, to be ashamed of it. Or with this. Or to do something with it. And then the fourth component of confident appeal. If we add sincerity to our activity. Remember now what and how Dmitry says in this record. Sincereness, openness, kindness, warmth, care for the interlocutor. Then it will be perceived as confidence. The fourth component, the fifth element, remember there. The fourth component is warmth. If there is no warmth, then the first three components without it will be perceived as aggression. How to make your speech sound warm? Well, listen. It is clear that this is a mood. That we are allies here. The mission of the world of the enemy. This is all we talked about. But there is also a very simple technical technique. This is when you do such a half-moon. And it's not about how sincerely and warmly you must smile to the interlocutor. By the way, now I am smiling too much. And this is not perceived as a sincere smile. Purely mechanically, when we raise the corners of our lips, then our voice begins to sound warmer. Purely mechanically, when we raise the corners of our lips, then our voice begins to sound warmer.\\n\\n## Section 3: Program Setting\\nText: Just a second. Hello, there are 3-5 options for application. Next, your question is whether they will be profitable for you, whether they will be profitable for you now. But you will look at it and say. If we choose, it turns out that nothing is profitable, but okay. Dmitry is doing two powerful things now, but these are already nuances. Again, now the most important thing to pay attention to is the correspondence with these four things. But I can't help but say it. Dmitry is doing the so-called program setting. He very calmly tells the interlocutor what will happen, what you will do with him. Program setting. He is sure, he knows what will happen.\\n\\n## Section 4: Opportunity to Say No\\nText: Look, very often, it's really funny. I agreed on a meeting, and here we meet with the interlocutor, and he is a little confused. Well, we met, but how to say. And out of this confusion, a person usually comes out. In such a way that he offers to tell something to me. He says, Evgeny, well, tell me about your proposal. Well, you can't, it's impossible. If you haven't asked the person, it's in vain to offer him something, to tell him. It will be missed, it will not be for him. Therefore, I always take initiative into my own hands. And I say, Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask you a few questions? Let it be. After the 24th year, they always say yes. There was not a single case in my practice, well, in real meetings, if we had already agreed on a meeting about sales, that a person would say no to me. Again, do you hear how these four criteria sound? Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask him a few questions? And the setting of the program. And the second thing that sounded great here in this excerpt is that Dmitry gives the opportunity to the interlocutor to say no. He directly says that we don't know if it will come in handy or not. But if it doesn't come in handy, well, we just won't continue, it's reasonable. And this is a very important thing. Remember, the main fear of the buyer, we said at the very beginning, is the fear of unwanted external subconscious influence. That somehow your teeth will speak to you. And you will spend money, and then you will feel like a fool. So when we speak confidently, and at the same time I specifically at each stage of sales, I just came to the fact that at each stage of sales I am building up this opportunity to say no. At the stage of the offer, I start with the minuses of my offer. At the stage of finding out the needs, we will talk to you about the funnel of questions. And then I will tell you. At some point I will definitely say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that you are simply guided. That is, I tell him again that I'm not trying to sell him now, he needs to make a decision about the purchase now. Or I can say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. I'm not selling you now, and this is very important. This is very relaxing for a person and causes trust. This is just what is now. I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. That is, I'm not selling you now and this is very important.\\n\\n## Section 5: Dealing with Doubts and Objections\\nText: Yes, and further Dmitry gives examples of how he deals with doubts and objections. But look, the most important thing, what is important for me here,\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction to Confident Appeal\\nText: in addition to the demonstration of what these four technical terms of confident appeal look like in the conversation,\\nis that you always say sensible, understandable things.\\nYou don't need to invent anything here.\\nYou just need to say what it is.\\nAnd don't be afraid to say what it is.\\nIt's not about that it may turn out that it doesn't fit.\\nIt may turn out that it will fit, but not in a profitable way.\\nAnd then we will finish on this.\\nIt's okay, it's normal.\\nThat is, we say it directly as it is.\\nThis is a striking thing, that really good sales is when we say it directly as it is with respect to ourselves and our interlocutor.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of Conversation Structure in Sales\\nText: But, such an important thing, just a daily conversation does not lead to sales.\\nThis is still a conversation that is arranged in a certain way,\\ncertain speech patterns are prepared,\\nreally correct intonation, correct state,\\nnot in order to deceive a person and sell him what he does not need,\\nbut in order to take these little needles, the fears of the buyer.\\n\\n## Section 3: Arranging Meetings and Communication Methods\\nText: Just a second, I'll take a look.\\nPerhaps there are still some questions for me here that I don't see.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nPerhaps the meeting is arranged through email?\\nListen, it's better to call and it's better to reach out to meet.\\nIf it doesn't work out anymore, then through correspondence.\\nIt's hard to hear Dmitry's phrase, half a word is not clear.\\nI have the maximum volume here.\\nOkay.\\nWell, yes, okay.\\nHow did it turn out?\\nYes, yes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nI have the maximum volume here.\\nWell, yes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nOkay.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\nYes.\\n\\n## Section 4: The Message of Confident Address\\nText: how it turned out I apologize but even if intonations are heard, in principle, this is already such a\\ngood enough thing, the main message of confident address, I am the sun, you are the sun, and I offer you a\\ncool thing, here is the intonation and the message these are another very important internal thing\\nthis is such a practical philosophy of sales in general and cold contact, including the\\ninternal position I want but I don't need it I want to be useful to you but I don't need it\\nI want to be useful to you but I don't need it\\nI want to be useful to you but I don't need it\\nI want to be useful to you but I don't need it I want to sell you at all setting\\nI don't need it at all setting\\nI don't need it at all setting granted see very important and that\\ngranted see, look very important and that\\ngranted see, look very important and that and other simultaneously it seems to be\\nand the other simultaneously it is sort of\\nand the other simultaneously it seems to be such partly contradictory things but\\nsome partly contradictory things but\\nsome partly contradictory things but important and yourself all time inside\\nimportant and yourself all the time but within\\nimportant and itself all the time but within self feel and other second keep\\nfeel and thing is another one keep\\nfeel and thing is another one keep contact to remind yourself it another and\\ncontact to remind yourself and that this\\ncontact to remind yourself and that this interlocutor\\ninterlocutor\\ninterlocutor remind such or another to speak about this\\nremind such or another to speak about this\\n\\n## Section 5: Reminding the Buyer of Their Freedom to Refuse\\nText: Well, about the fact that you don't need it, you actually remind yourself every time you give a person the opportunity to refuse.\\nWell, as Dmitry said, I don't know how much it was heard or not heard, that the meaning was that it may turn out that this is not suitable for you.\\nIn general, the introduction of artificial intelligence is now, in principle, not suitable. And then it's okay, and then we'll finish.\\nAnd then he said that if we find out that it is suitable, it will be necessary to calculate whether it is profitable for you or not, and it may turn out to be unprofitable.\\nAnd this will also be a normal result. We will understand this. And if we understand that it will be profitable, look, when Dmitry said this,\\nhe actually stated that he did not need it.\\nAnd then he said that he really did not need it and he now has this ability to sell it to this interlocutor.\\nBut at the same time, there was clearly a curiosity both in the text and in the voice.\\nI want to meet with you, I want to figure it out, I want to cooperate with you.\\nAnd this is a very important message. And both.\\n\\n## Section 6: The Role of Salesperson as Actor, Sapper, and Psychologist\\nText: There will be no I want, there will be just a formal speech of the text.\\nno more. There will be a need, any feeling that you seem to need it, that it is very important for you to\\nagree on a meeting, it is very important to sell it, it is very important to make money, it will directly\\nactivate, fall into the fear of unwanted external influence, and it will be\\nactivated. The truth is that a salesman is an actor, a sapper, a psychologist. Well, it is clear why an actor, a\\npsychologist, a sapper. Why? Not to push, but if you push a little, well, a person will have the impression\\nthat you are pressing on him and there will be a protest, well, it will explode. Very calmly. Look, this is, well,\\ndefinitely this is not higher mathematics, this is not higher piloting. We\\nare talking about very simple rules, and when you use them in conversations, and on the phone,\\nand at face-to-face meetings, first, if you have not done this, you will succeed in different ways,\\nincluding completely clumsy, including completely not succeed, and in some cases something\\nwill already work out, and this is normal and correct. Slowly. They say that it is methodically impossible to\\nlearn several things at the same time. Well, that is, it is methodically impossible to learn how to\\nthrow a ball, how to throw a ball, how to throw a ball, how to throw a ball, how to throw a ball, how to throw a ball, how to throw a ball.\\nAnd far and accurately, at once. First you need to learn to throw far, and then\\nalso accurately. Or first exactly, and then and far. Therefore, in your real conversations on the\\nphone, you will first succeed in something, and the other will fly into the tartar. And this is normal.\\n\\n## Section 1: Learning to Drive a Car\\nThis is when I learned to drive a car, and there was a candidate in the driver, well, something is clear, the entire volume is not mastered. And any wasting situation on the road led to me in a stupor. A delicate mold of perception arose. The world becomes one point. And this is normal. In the stress, any normal person is cow-bTAtles, that is, in stress, any normal person can focus on something. But something's one. That's it.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of Keeping an Eye Out\\nGood sales are when you have learned to keep an eye out for something. First of all, something is one. The rest is how it turns out. Then you do it for yourself, lower your standards. It turns Then they learned to focus on something else and connected it with the first one. Well, good, you already have two things. In general, the analogy with learning how to drive a car here is complete. This is like any sales skill.\\n\\n## Section 3: Simple and Effective Strategies\\nTherefore, on the one hand, we have already said several things that seem to be necessary to be taken into account at the same time. Do not be afraid that at first it will be difficult for you to keep them in your head at the same time. But they are simple, effective, working. In fact, everything that is most effective is very simple. And another important fundamental thing.\\n\\n## Section 4: Never Decide for the Client\\nWhen you go to the company. It sounds scary to go to the company. When are you going to call? Call there, I don't know, through a checkbox. Try to come up with a face-to-face decision. What will work out, what will not work out. Get either to the secretary, or to the accountant. Or to the deputy, who does not decide anything. Well, one way or another. When you will master this new area for yourself. Also a very important thing. Never decide for the client. Never decide for the potential buyer. Whether he needs it or not. This is a sin in which they fall. All starting sellers. They begin to pretend. But again, from this fear of refusal. Fear of rejection. That this is better not to call. They don't need it. And this is better not to call. And this is not necessary. And this may be. But he needs to call at this time. On this day of the week. And not in place. Okay, I'll call you in a week. Never decide for the client. Whether he needs it or not.\\n\\n## Section 5: Examples of Successful Sales Approaches\\nI sell corporate training. And I had situations. Well, completely anecdotal. When I call the veterinary clinic. Well, what are the sales in the veterinary clinic? Well, just by the reference book. I call stupidly. And suddenly it turns out that this veterinary clinic. Has the same owners as the network. Well. Veterinary stores. Well, pet stores, rather. And I agree on a meeting. With these owners. And God bless her with the clinic. She somehow got around without me. And with the network of pet stores. I did the training then. Earned money. Or I came. Well, I live in Arkhangelsk. I came to conduct another training in the neighboring city. Well, the neighboring, there is another area. Volgda. And there is a shop. Well, kind of like the Union of Printing. Shop. The end of goods. And all sorts of hands. It's called a journalist. Well, there are two and a half people working in the shop. They don't need it. Well, I don't know the city. Fortunately, I didn't know that it was just a small shop. But it turned out that the shop belongs to the publishing house. Cherepovets. The publishing house Cherepovets. And I met. And I had a great, wonderful training there. And I got recommendations from them. That is, any contacts. It's true here. Make contacts. Or in one of the Rai centers. I meet. In the early 2000s. Owners. They have their own small computer store. Well, the computer, of course. But it's a small store. But it's a small store. They sell everything there. They haven't extinguished them yet. Federal networks. And I'm talking there. Guys, two co-owners. There's a pile of questions. I'll do everything. No, they don't buy. They talk about it directly. Because they have a reorganization scheduled. They are going to move. In general, not before that. And I ask them a simple stupid question. Okay, tell me, who do you know? Who would be interested in it? Please, don't neglect. I'm stupid. Without any hope. Just because it needs to be done. I asked them this question. When they refused. And they called me a local entrepreneur. Who has several business directions. They say, just don't say that we called you. Well, I already left. I returned to my city. I call from there. Honestly, I don't say who gave me his phone number. I don't say who gave me his phone number. I don't say who gave me his phone number. I don't say who gave me his phone number. We start talking to him. And in the following years, if I'm not mistaken, I did six trainings with him. Don't decide. Or another example. There can be an infinite number of such examples. At the height of the crisis of 2008, the sales of cars fell by 50%. The sales of cars fell by 50%. The sales of cars fell by 50%. The world crisis. I also come to one city to conduct training. And a friend of mine asks me. In such and such a company, you talked to them. They sell cars. Sales fell by 50%. What kind of training? She says, well, call. I remembered that I always at the trainings I say that never decide for the client. Never decide for the buyer. And I call. I still remember how they called the manager and said, you know, now there is a crisis. All training programs have been temporarily stopped. But we have now opened a new unit. And we urgently need to train people. When do you have the opportunity to meet and talk? I say, today. Today. I already have a ticket for the evening. And we met. And really, in the midst of a crisis, I did two trainings with them. Because it turned out that crisis is not a crisis. But they really built up and opened a new salon. And after that, I grabbed the phone and began to call all the salons. Listen. In CES. Sanepidemstantie. But now it is called differently. It was completely not a cold call. I wouldn't have thought to call them. Well, because where are the sales? Where is CES?\\n\\n## Section 1: Someone just recommended me.\\nSomeone just recommended me.\\nWe called the manager.\\nIt turned out for them\\nthis topic is relevant.\\nI grabbed my head,\\nbut I didn't think about CES.\\nAnd I called CES\\nSanepidemstantie\\nin Arkhangelsk.\\nIn the Arkhangelsk region.\\nDo you know what they said to me?\\nThey said,\\nit's a pity that you called us now.\\nA few months ago,\\nwe just spent money on sales.\\nThis is not to decide.\\nJust\\ntake it and do it.\\nDon't think who needs it,\\nwho doesn't need it. People decide for themselves.\\nOur task is to offer them.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of timing in cold calls\\nAnd now the last thing.\\nIn two minutes we will go\\non a 10-minute break.\\nLook, what else is important\\nfor cold calls?\\nThere is no right or wrong time.\\nThis is a game of the mind.\\nWhen you start making cold calls,\\nyou will face it 100%.\\nThat you will think,\\n5 minutes is too early to call.\\nAnd in the late evening,\\nthey are already going to work,\\nit's too late to call.\\nAnd on Monday,\\nit's better not to call,\\nthe week begins.\\nAnd on Friday,\\nit's useless to call,\\nbecause they will forget to appoint meetings\\nduring the weekend.\\nLook, this is all crap.\\nThis is really crap.\\nPractice shows it.\\nI sat down for a phone call\\nat 9 a.m.\\nand at 7 p.m.\\nsomeone is still at work,\\nit turns out that he is delayed.\\nAnd on the eve of the weekend\\nthe meetings were assigned\\nnothing worse\\nthan the time that I\\nscientifically calculated for myself.\\nThis is all out of fear.\\nAgain, don't decide.\\nCall at any time.\\nIn the end, you call at 9 a.m.,\\nyou will be told that the person is now busy.\\nIt is convenient for him to call.\\nCall in series.\\nThat is, after a pause,\\nyou have to get together again.\\nThe excitement and fear return again.\\nBut if you sat down for a phone call\\nand you have already made at least\\na few calls,\\nyou talked,\\nfor you the initial stress has gone.\\nListen, even now,\\nI haven't made cold calls for a long time,\\nbut I have built my practice in such a way\\nthat they turn to me either\\nby recommendations or repeatedly.\\nAnd despite the fact that I can do it\\nand have been doing it for many years,\\nif after a long pause I sit down now,\\nfirst I will be worried\\nand my voice will be changed.\\nI will forget some words there.\\nI will need a piece of paper in front of my eyes\\nor keep a monitor\\nwhere the text is written.\\nBut when there are several conversations,\\nthe stress goes away\\nand we begin to speak more calmly.\\n\\n## Section 3: Starting with the unnecessary and personal statistics\\nNext, start with the unnecessary.\\nWell, unnecessary, I mean\\nthat for a warm-up\\nat the beginning of such a series of calls\\nyou can call somewhere\\nwhere you decided for a potential buyer\\nthat it is almost hopeless there.\\nBut still, they will not meet with you\\nor will not be able to buy,\\nbut just to talk.\\nThere are pleasant surprises.\\nYou treated them unnecessarily,\\nand they appointed a meeting and bought.\\nTo carry out personal statistics.\\nWhat does it mean to carry out personal statistics?\\nWell, let's say I came to the city,\\nI made\\n64 calls.\\nOf these 64 calls,\\nwell, just by reference,\\nby yellow pages,\\nall available,\\n32 I got\\nwith leaders of different levels.\\nNot just with managers,\\nwith accountants.\\nThey put me on the list\\nof decision-makers.\\nOf them, it turned out\\nto appoint 16 meetings.\\nOf these 16 meetings,\\nfour showed\\nclear, clear interest\\nand willingness to buy.\\nOf them, in the near future,\\nthere was one sale.\\nWell, then there were more sales\\non recommendations and so on.\\nAnd this is normal, good statistics.\\nIt may differ from you.\\nBut in general, this is normal statistics.\\nWhy is it important to carry it?\\nBecause if you are told no,\\nand they say no,\\nand they say no,\\nyour mood falls on cold calls.\\nYou come across, well, really,\\nif I know that I have,\\naccording to my personal statistics,\\nwell, let's say every fourth,\\nwell, at least every 20th call,\\nit doesn't matter,\\nlet every 20th call end\\nwith a meeting agreement.\\nThen look what happens.\\nI get one refusal,\\nsecond refusal, fifth refusal.\\nWhat is my internal state?\\nGreat, good, cool.\\nThis brings me closer\\nto my 20th call\\nwhen a meeting will be appointed.\\nI have my 16th refusal.\\nYou see, if I don't know\\nmy statistics,\\nthen it becomes more and more dull\\nfor me to call.\\nI can stop calling.\\nI can start to perceive this activity\\nas hopeless.\\nWell, listen, I made 19 calls,\\neveryone says no,\\nno one needs it,\\nit doesn't work,\\nI'm the last one.\\nWhy did I study all this?\\nI don't want to sell it to anyone.\\nI have 19 calls,\\nI'm out of sales.\\n19th refusal,\\nI'm already starting to rub my hands\\nthat, oh, cool.\\nAnd maybe it's like that\\n23 refusals in a row.\\nYes, then with every call\\nI'm getting closer and closer.\\nMaybe I'll get 38 refusals,\\nand then I'll get two in a row.\\nAgain, look, every fourth,\\nevery 20th is a discount.\\nYou will have your own personal statistics.\\nAnd if there are a lot of refusals,\\nyou can make a pause,\\nslow down,\\nmaybe record yourself on a recorder,\\nlisten,\\nsomehow correct,\\nmaybe somewhere a little bit\\nthe voice sounds uncertain,\\nsome formulations,\\nand continue again.\\nWell, the truth is,\\nyour statistics can be improved,\\nand it will inevitably improve.\\n\\n## Section 4: Keeping the text in front of your eyes\\nWell, and the last thing,\\nkeep your text in front of your eyes.\\nThe first couple of years, at least,\\nthese are simple working phrases\\nwith which you talk\\nand answers to doubts and objections.\\nIt relieves stress,\\nyou don't have to think.\\nI have, well, just about,\\nprobably in two years,\\nwhen I was already making cold calls,\\nI also come to some city,\\nI sit down,\\nI make cold calls\\non the pages of the guidebook,\\nand suddenly I have no meetings at all.\\nI don't know, well, I made 20 calls,\\nthere is no, there is no meeting at all.\\nNo one knows,\\nbut it is clear that\\nsomething very unusual.\\nAnd I think, what am I doing wrong,\\nas always?\\nAh, the text.\\nI remember the text in general,\\nbut apparently I still had to\\nmake an effort\\nto remember it at that moment,\\nsome amount of attention was spent,\\nand as a result it sounded\\na little bit uncertain.\\nI didn't realize it,\\nbut if I make a call\\nand at least a little bit\\nit sounds uncertain to me,\\nthen the interlocutor may perceive\\nthat I am not sure about my proposal.\\n\\n## Section 1: Appointment of Meetings\\nText: well, the appointment of meetings.\\n\\n## Section 2: Time and Break\\nText: Therefore, it is solved very simply,\\nbut the text before your eyes\\nis as much time as you need.\\nFriends,\\nnow,\\nyes, 13.36\\nuntil 13.46\\nis a break,\\n\\n## Section 3: Scripts, Scenarios, Cold Calls\\nText: scripts, scripts, scenarios,\\ncold calls.\\n\\n## Section 4: Job Search and Communication\\nText: not to say to your acquaintances, you know, it would be interesting for me to work in such and such an area,\\nand maybe in such and such a list of professions, well, the person will be confused, he will not know what to say.\\nOne thing, let's say, if I'm looking for a job, then I can say that I'm looking for a job in this direction,\\nor I'm looking for a job in such and such a position, in such and such a position, period, one thing.\\nTwo or three are not necessary, it's an overload, but one thing is to say to everyone, so that everyone just knows it.\\nSomewhere it usually works, if we are talking about the search for a job, not those people who I would think about,\\nwith whom I have good friendship or family relations, in general, someone happens to have their first job,\\nbut I have a friend who is a psychologist, I started studying to be a psychologist in 2000,\\nand in 2001 I started working in a teaching center, and my wife was a music teacher then,\\nand a man came to us, and he turned out to be a teacher of computer courses in this teaching center.\\nAnd he just knew that I had started, I was already a student, I was studying to be a psychologist,\\nand I wanted to do something.\\nAnd when the director said that he wanted to take a psychologist to work,\\nso that there were cycles of training to conduct all sorts of hairdressers,\\nand secretaries of referents, and sellers, and warehouse operators,\\nthere was simply a plan for how many hours of psychology, but he recommended me,\\nand it was my first official job in this regard.\\nBut for this it was necessary that my...\\nA student of my wife, who is engaged in piano,\\nknew that I am a psychologist and want to work as a psychologist.\\n\\n## Section 5: Request for Social Network Post\\nText: And then I have a request, if you are familiar with your friends,\\nnow there are social networks, in your social networks,\\npost, say some indisputable message about the fact that\\nyou want, are looking for the opportunity to implement the technologies of artificial intelligence in companies.\\nYou are doing this now.\\nI have a request for you.\\nWrite now, formulate this phrase.\\nA phrase that you could say to everyone who knows you.\\nAnd knowing those who know you.\\nWhat do you want?\\nWhat do you do?\\nWhat do you want from them?\\nPlease, two minutes to formulate some phrase.\\nAnd please write in our chat where the questions and answers.\\nThank you so much.\\n\\n## Section 6: Acknowledgment and Response\\nText: And...\\nThank you.\\nThank you too.\\nI take it, maybe.\\nYes, by the way, Sergey is doing an amazing thing, he is actually already me as a presenter, now I am his acquaintance, we are taking part in one course with him, I am his teacher on the course, and he is now offering me cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence.\\nSergey, right now I will not think about it, because I am completely in the course, but I read it and I will think about it.\\nAnd this is exactly what I am talking about now, do not decide for a person, you somehow intersect with him, you tell him something, and he decides.\\nEmily, I was pushed out of sales, I will not go to my acquaintances anymore, I have already caught up with everyone.\\n\\n## Section 7: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\\nText: I create business solutions based on artificial intelligence, I am engaged in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence in the company.\\nThere is some kind of business solution, but I do not know what it is.\\nI am some kind of person who has his own production or some kind of boss.\\nI am studying artificial intelligence, I am studying all possible areas of its use.\\nI am engaged in the selection of artificial intelligence technologies for various businesses.\\nI am now engaged in the implementation of various enterprises, perhaps you know those who would be interested.\\nI am now engaged in the question of how to use artificial intelligence to solve production and business tasks.\\nWhat do you think, where can you apply artificial intelligence?\\nYes, there are different options, think, twist, write it down for yourself.\\nHere it should be, well, first of all, that you are engaged in this,\\nsecondly, that you are not offering it now at the enterprise,\\nbut you are looking for the opportunity to apply it in the most different organizations,\\nat the most different enterprises and companies.\\nAnd while it is not yet known where it can be applied at a specific enterprise and where not,\\nbut that it is promising.\\nIn general, somehow briefly, so that the person to whom you said this did not have the impression\\nthat it is now necessary for him to make a decision,\\nwhether artificial intelligence is needed at some enterprise or not.\\nYes, God forbid, he will definitely not think about it.\\nHere is such a light message, not necessary, but accurate,\\nabout the fact that you are engaged in the technologies of artificial intelligence,\\nwhich is really, as Dima said, something like the Internet.\\nWhat will be required at some point already at all enterprises,\\nbut now it is only being implemented.\\nAnd what you are doing now,\\nyou are looking for, meeting with the leaders of the most different enterprises\\nand together with them you are looking for the opportunity where they can apply it.\\nIf it is possible, if it is not, then no.\\nAnd listen, you know someone who works in some organization\\nand makes decisions, a leader of any level,\\nwho, in principle, some new decisions,\\nsuch as the introduction of the Internet,\\nand now artificial intelligence.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Background\\nText: can be interesting, in principle, in general.\\nI am saying too much now, but the meaning is exactly this.\\n\\n## Section 2: Concerns about Business Training\\nText: Listen, I have had such a concern for many years that I mostly earned from business training. And business training is such a situation that it is either empty or empty, well, corporate. And it turned out that in general, in the middle of the month, I earned very well, well, not bad. But I, well, training is how much? I spend several days a month. The rest of the time, well, to rest, of course, is good, but I am prone to boredom. Melancholic introvert.\\n\\n## Section 3: Consulting as a Psychologist\\nText: And, well, somehow the mood was falling, I was driving, somehow sobbing, and so on. But at the same time, I consulted as a psychologist, a consultant, but, well, how, people recognized me, they, let's say, knew me personally, were on my some kind of training, someone recommended me, and from time to time I consulted.\\n\\n## Section 4: Becoming a Psychotherapist\\nText: And in 2013, I went to study as a psychotherapist, just for myself, I was not going to work. And at some point, well, for certification, I spent four years of training there, and at some point for certification, so that they would already give me a piece of paper that I had finished. It was necessary to describe three cases, well, about 10-12 sessions, with real, real clients. And something, well, what real, real clients, how will they find out about me, where will they come from, who do I need, I haven't actually worked yet as a gestalt psychotherapist.\\n\\n## Section 5: Writing about Working with People\\nText: And my teacher, she says, listen, well, what are you, I'm watching your social networks, and why don't you write about it? Why don't you write about the fact that you would like to work with people? And I remember my feeling at that moment, that she doesn't understand anything. She says some kind of nonsense thing, that, well, I'll write, but people know that I'm not really a gestalt therapist, that I'm not a professional in this area, that I'm just, well, how? Well, what? Well, no, this is something unreasonable. Then I sat down for a while, thought, and wrote the truth, well, this is adequate, some sensible things. I wrote about the fact that, in general, I've been practicing psychology for many years, practical. And I've been studying gestalt therapy for more than four years. And I'm a student, but I'm such a smart student, I'm interested. And for certification, I need a description of two or three cases. And if you're also interested, then for half the fee, I'm ready to take there, then you can take, you can ask any questions, I just can't think of others. History is beautiful, history is a beautiful subject, so if you believe in the essence of psychology, then ask once, then you'll find a great teacher, which is really well known. And that's the choice for you, I'll take, because personality is great, and there aren't too many people, but if you have, how many people? Yeah, Like these persons, I have four different에게 Head of feelsi character a bölк g g about the fact that I am a professional in this field, a beginner professional, who takes money from his experience and competence. And I want to, I'm ready to work, I'm interested. Please respond. And they responded.\\n\\n## Section 6: Cold Calling and Introducing Yourself\\nText: Okay, scripts. Yes, the passage of the turning point. Usually, when you make a cold call, you take a phone from the general available sources, and there is a phone, well, it is clear, not a personal director, but a person who, well, the phone of the reception director. There is the office of the secretary, the office of the manager, the secretary, and so on. The general name of such people through which your call passes is the turner, he is kind of at the gate. And such a standard scheme is when you call, you call, and the phone is turned off. Yes. And then you say who you are, what you are doing, for what purpose you are calling, and, in fact, what you need right now. And then, well, such a call in its pure form. Hello, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev. Well, when I called, the first years I said, in general, the last name and surname. Then it became easier to relate to this, the last name and surname. You can do whatever you want. But if you still say the last name, by calling some organization, you give yourself an additional status. Here. Your classes. Well, I said, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev, I am a business trainer. Well, when we were together with our colleague of the company, whom we loudly called the center of practical psychology of information, I said, good afternoon, my name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev, the center of practical psychology of information. Well, when we parted and I began to represent only myself, I began to simply say that I am a business trainer. Next, what did I say? God, I said, yes, I asked, tell me, who in your company is engaged in personnel training? I was often sent, especially if there is a small company, and there is no special HR there, a person who deals with personnel, I was sent directly to the director, well, or to the HR, which also satisfied me. In your situation, this question, tell me, who is engaged in the introduction of artificial intelligence? Well, an absurd one. Most likely, no one. At the same time, you really need to go, perhaps, to a higher person in the organization. If there is a general director there, then to the general director. Well, why? It is clear that the higher the position of a person in the organization, the more information he has about all departments. Because it is not clear to you yet in which department the technology can work, be required for them. The second is a person who makes decisions. And it was also a revelation for me, although I, in general, was not a naive person, when I encountered in practice once, and not for the first year of my work, I suddenly made this amazing discovery, that you are talking to some one deputy director about how things are going for them and what they need.\\n\\n## Section 1: Different Perspectives in Organizations\\nHere, they talked in detail, you make a proposal, then you meet with another organization leader,\\nwell, let's say, actually, with the director, and everything is completely different for him.\\nNot only the idea of goals, but also the picture in general, how and what works in their organizations,\\nit may not coincide at all.\\nAs if they work in different worlds.\\nIt is clear that this is about some imperfection of their interaction in the organization.\\nBut listen.\\nWe are definitely dealing with imperfect organizations.\\nEach of them has its own problems.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of Meeting with Higher Person in Organization\\nTherefore, if you are not talking to the first person in the organization,\\nyou went to some leader, but he is not the first person in the organization,\\nthen you can talk to him about everything and make a pilot project on the basis of your conversation.\\nBut when the decision will then be made by the senior person,\\nit may go to the cat's tail, unfortunately, in some cases.\\nBecause the senior...\\nThe senior person may have a different opinion.\\nThis does not mean that we are neglecting...\\nYes, this does not mean that we are neglecting to somehow say,\\nno, only either with the general director,\\nor I will not meet with anyone there to talk in the organization.\\nBut also this moment to understand that, first of all,\\nwe strive to meet with the higher person in the organization as much as possible.\\nAnd if we meet not with the higher person,\\nthen we try to go through him to the higher person.\\nYes, we talk to him.\\nYes, we interest him.\\nWe establish a contact.\\nWe find out his picture.\\nBut this is an intermediate link.\\nLet it not sound cynical.\\nThis is a step in order to go to the general director.\\n\\n## Section 3: Involving Others in Decision-Making\\nThere is a phrase that I have further written in this presentation.\\nIf we go to some leader, not the higher person,\\nnot the chief director of the organization,\\nwe can ask, Petr Petrovich,\\nif you like everything and you want to implement it in your organization,\\nis there anyone else who needs to be advised about this?\\nWho will take part in the decision-making?\\nAnd, let's say, he says, yes, there is such a person.\\nYou explain the person or the circle of faces,\\nand then you suggest.\\nFirst of all, he says,\\nPetr Petrovich,\\ncan we meet with them then?\\nWell, so as not to get up twice.\\nDon't be afraid of that.\\nWell, it won't work out, it won't work out.\\nThen you will talk to this person for now.\\nBut at the earliest stage,\\nif you like everything and you want to implement it in yourself,\\nthen who else in the organization will need to talk about it?\\nWhat opinion to take into account,\\nwith whom else to agree?\\nAnd then you immediately, you remember,\\ndirectly, without asking,\\nwe offer the person to already be included in the meeting.\\nThree, four.\\nYes.\\n\\n## Section 4: Approach to Contacting the Director\\nScript, which is, well, such a standard, basic.\\nI offer you.\\nI'm calling about the use of artificial intelligence in your company.\\nThat is, well, what am I talking about?\\nCan I talk to your director?\\nDo you remember the intonation of the formal question?\\nThere is still such a little, well,\\nintonation shock.\\nYou kind of hint at the answer.\\nCan I talk to your director?\\nI'm a little breathing pause.\\nIt kind of emphasizes this word.\\nI can talk.\\nAnd you can still, even if you talk on the phone,\\nnod a little bit assertively.\\nI can talk to your director.\\nThis is natural.\\nThe grass is green.\\nThe water is wet.\\nThe sky is blue.\\nI can talk to your director.\\nConfident appeal.\\nRemember?\\nOn equal terms, directly with the intonation of the formal question and warmth.\\nAnd what is his name?\\nUh-huh.\\nIf you are told.\\nNow he is busy.\\nCould you give me his contact phone number?\\n\\n## Section 5: Applying Sales Techniques\\nThere was a funny story, too, in the same city.\\nWhen I literally call the store on the yellow pages of the guidebook.\\nAnd I turn to the manager.\\nWell, who is the seller?\\nThe manager picks up the phone.\\nI ask him.\\nI imagine.\\nI ask who in their organization is engaged in training staff.\\nHe nods.\\nWell, probably the director.\\nI say.\\nUh-huh.\\nThe director.\\nTell me, what is his name?\\nDmitry Eduardovich.\\nI still remember Dmitry Eduardovich.\\nCould you give me his contact phone number?\\nHe gives.\\nI call.\\nI agree on a meeting with Dmitry Eduardovich.\\nThe first question at the meeting.\\nWho gave you my phone number?\\nAnd then it comes to me.\\nI didn't even realize that I applied the technique.\\nThis is already becoming a skill.\\nAnd, well, I don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nI don't know.\\nDo you know what?\\nWell, you know.\\nWell, they had a direct ban on giving the director's phone.\\nAnd I told him.\\nWell, you know, do not swear at the manager.\\nI actually applied one of the sales techniques, which, in turn, I am teaching your managers.\\nYeah.\\nIf they refuse to give you contact on the phone, which is really quite common.\\nAnd when it is more convenient for me to call back.\\nWhen it is more convenient for me to call back.\\nAnd again, this is a hidden invitation.\\nIt will be more convenient for me to call back.\\nThey usually say.\\nLook, if they say, you leave your phone number and he will call you back, if anything.\\nWell, of course, you need to leave your phone number, but it is extremely unlikely that the director will somehow actively call you back in this situation.\\nWell, yes, the number was left, but immediately say, you know, I will still call back to leave this opportunity.\\nNow look, what was above is such a completely standard option and it can work well.\\nWhat else did I do?\\nI tried, look, it can be done, it can not be done, that's what I'm proposing now.\\nBut I did it.\\nAt least in some cases.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Personal Contact\\nText: And this, I think, gives a good additional result.\\nI tried to establish some kind of personal human contact with the turner, well, the secretary.\\nAgain, good afternoon, my name is Evgeny Arsenievich Yakovlev, business trainer.\\n\\n## Section 2: Introducing Yourself and Asking for the Other Person's Name\\nText: And then, in general, according to the label, when a person picks up the phone in the organization, then he introduces himself, calls himself.\\nWell, then the person's name is further.\\nWe use the name of the person.\\nIn some cases it is not presented.\\nWell, yes, in fact, so.\\nAgain, right, wrong, but this is reality.\\nAnd if a person did not introduce himself, then we take the name.\\nAlso calmly, confidently.\\nConfidently, remember the intonation of the formal question.\\nMy name is Evgeny Arsenievich Yakovlev, I am a business trainer.\\nWhat's your name?\\nThis is reasonable.\\nYou gave your name and ask for the name of the person.\\nWell, the person says, for example, Olga.\\nOlga, very nice.\\nWell, if a person says ...\\n\\n## Section 3: Using Personal Appeal for Help\\nText: There are very different organizations, including those that may require emotional, I wanted to say, artificial intelligence.\\nThis is where he says, why do you need it?\\nWell, in such cases, I said ...\\nJust to say goodbye to you.\\nWell, in 90% of cases, after that, people were represented there.\\nMy name is Evgeny.\\nAnd then this appeal, Olga, Irina, could you help me?\\nWhy does it work?\\nThis is a personal appeal for help.\\nThis is one of the heuristics.\\nHeuristics in social psychology are called thinking automatisms, reaction automatisms.\\nWhen we politely appeal for help, a person gets everything that his mother taught him.\\nThat normal, good, polite people, when they appeal to us for help, well, in general, good girls, good boys, well, rather, help.\\nThen what do we do?\\nWe appeal in a compulsive inclination.\\nTell me, could you help me?\\nWe don't say, help me.\\nOlga, could you help me?\\nIntonation of a formal question.\\nCould you wash your hands?\\nCould you help me?\\nIn general, in sales, compulsive inclination is a question of a hint.\\nWhat if?\\nWe don't need your artificial intelligence.\\nYes.\\nIt is quite possible that you don't need it at all.\\nAnd if you thought about using artificial intelligence, what would be important for you, first of all?\\nAnd people suddenly start talking.\\nBecause compulsive inclination.\\nThey don't need to make a decision now.\\nCould you help me?\\nIn principle, yes.\\nAnd then what is called a trap of consistency.\\nWhen a person agrees on something, it is psychologically difficult for him to refuse help further.\\nLook, I'm not saying that it works in 100% of cases, that it works iron like a hammer.\\nBut this definitely increases the probability.\\nAll techniques of influence guarantee nothing.\\nBut very clearly, they increase the probability.\\nAt the same time, one chip with a high probability does not work.\\nThere should be a lot of chips.\\nIf you have a lot of chips, one of them or a set of them will take action.\\nOlga, could you help me?\\nYes or what?\\n\\n## Section 4: Connecting with the Director\\nText: I'm calling about the use of artificial intelligence in your company.\\nUsually these questions are discussed with the director.\\nCould you connect me with him?\\nWhat's his name?\\nWhat do you do?\\nWhat are we doing here?\\nYou are talking again about the goal.\\nAnd then you explain why you ask to connect you with the director.\\nNot the head of the IT unit, for example, in the organization.\\nI don't know what it may be called.\\nYou say how it usually happens.\\nThis is the picture of the world.\\nYou are painting a picture of the world.\\nThat usually it happens like this.\\nThis can also be called.\\nwith the proposal of the program. Usually these questions are discussed with the director. Usually,\\nhands after the toilet are washed. Where can you wash your hands? This is about it. When they tell you,\\nwell, such a standard thing, send your proposal by email. The first step is always\\njoining. Look, what Dmitry, I think we will listen to his resolution in the next webinar,\\nand his options will answer typical doubts and objections. Dmitry, in a conversation with the\\ndirector directly, he directly says that no, it is impossible to prepare and send a presentation in advance\\n, this is such a special area. But this is at the level of the conversation\\n. But this is at the level of the conversation. But this is at the level of the conversation. But this is at the level of the conversation.\\nalready with the director, with the person making the decision. There is a different degree of interest and\\nresponsibility. The secretary in this case, he just makes a decision to skip or not to skip.\\nEverything. To delve into the problems, tasks, organizations and opportunities is already a overload for the\\nsecretary. Therefore, the secretary needs to be relieved. Therefore, here we do not exaggerate that there is nothing there,\\nit is impossible, because she says, well, it is impossible, so it is impossible.\\nI sympathize. Therefore, the first step is always to join. Yes, of course, I will send a proposal by e-mail.\\n\\n## Section 5: Techniques for Persuasion\\nText: In order to prepare a proposal, this technique, the first technique is to play in the fog, or it is also called\\npsychological Aikido or total yes. Well, in general, when we respond to an objection with agreement,\\nwe agree with something. Yes, of course, I will send a proposal by e-mail. The next is a technique exactly for the\\ntransformation of disadvantages into advantages. The technique is exactly for this.\\nIn order to prepare a proposal that can be really interesting and useful for your company,\\nI call your director. Olga, could you connect me with him? That is, you said the reason,\\nit sounds appropriate, it sounds running, it sounds confident. You said something appropriate,\\nand then you give the person, well, guidance to action. Could you connect me with him?\\nAgain, without a doubt, this is important, the intonation of a formal question. Could you connect me with him?\\nDoes it really work? Well, let's say in my case, when they told me to send your proposal by e-mail,\\n\\n## Section 1: Proposal and Business Advice\\nText: I always said, conditionally, Irina, yes, of course, I will send a proposal by e-mail, I am exactly for that, and I offer business advice. Yes, of course, I will send a proposal by e-mail, I am exactly for that, and I offer business advice. In order to prepare such a proposal, which can really be for your organization, which, God, I already forgot, I am exactly for that and I offer business advice, in order to prepare such a proposal, which can really be interesting and useful for you.\\n\\n## Section 2: Importance of the Meeting\\nText: The meeting will take 10-15 minutes. Is this possible? It sounds reasonable, reasonable. Well, it is clear that this turn to a business meeting is when, already in a telephone conversation with the director. In a conversation with the turner, we say, we do not sell the business meeting, but we sell, well, conditionally, so that it connects us with the director. Therefore, well, as I wrote here, such an option. Or it may be a more detailed explanation. But what Dmitry said in the excerpt that we listened to, he actually explained quite elaborately. Well, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say. And it sounded very clear, very clear, very logical, and it took quite a bit of time. And if by this sample, it will be something like this, Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail. I call precisely in order to prepare an offer for your company.\\n\\n## Section 3: Importance of Turner Conversation\\nText: Olga, the technology of artificial intelligence and neural networks is a completely new area. In companies, there are most often no specialists who are already engaged in this. That is why the first conversation with the turner is very important. And this is what we are doing with the director. I am calling your director now to agree on a meeting. Could you connect me with him?\\n\\n## Section 4: Speaking with Confidence\\nText: Well, look, I am now speaking a little impatiently, a little with a teacher's intonation. And this is due to the fact that I see that there are nine minutes left until the end of the webinar, and I am in a hurry. Purely technically. And if we speak faster, it can create a sense of uncertainty. A sense of impatience, some kind of impatience of ours. What makes a person impatient? He may not be sure. Therefore, purely technically, how to create a feeling of greater confidence? Well, as I am doing now. This is slowing down the tempo of speech and lowering the intonation at the end of the phrase. Well, compare. Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail. Or, Olga, yes, of course, I will send an offer by e-mail. I will call exactly in order to prepare an offer for your company. We are slowing down.\\n\\n## Section 5: Practice and Improvement\\nText: It didn't work out in a specific conversation. I still drove. It's okay. In the next conversation, we pay attention again. We are slowing down. Remember, it is impossible to learn how to throw the ball at the same time, far and wide. We apply the skills. It's okay. When the text is for you. When the text is not new for you. Well, this text is just an example. It's not that you literally need to read it. You can rework it somehow for yourself, for your style, for your understanding. But I literally wrote this text last night when I was preparing the presentation. And for me it is quite new. It would take me time for it to sound completely natural for me. When I don't need to focus on the text itself. And then it becomes like the cells of my body, my skin, my skin. Then the shell is just a shell in which I reflect the message itself. And then it sounds completely calm, completely confident.\\n\\n## Section 6: Setting up the Meeting\\nText: The appointment of the meeting is already directly with the manager. Peter Petrovich, good afternoon. My name is Evgeny Arsenyevich Yakovlev or Evgeny Yakovlev. I am a business trainer. And your definition of what you are doing. Who are you as a person who is engaged in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence and neural networks in organizations? Do you now have the opportunity to speak?\\n\\n## Section 7: Indirect Impressions and Soft Influence\\nText: Again, remember, you can wash your hands. Do you now have the opportunity to speak? Again. All this. All this devil in detail. When a formal question, then it seems to be a questioning proposal, but we do not ask in fact. The question would sound like this. Do you now have the opportunity to speak? Now I don't know. Now I ask. Do you now have the opportunity to speak? This is what I ask. And then he also begins to think. Do I have the opportunity to speak? Or do I not have the opportunity to speak? It seems that I have just been engaged in some important business. No. We say. Do you now have the opportunity to speak? I have no doubt. Can you wash your hands? Do you now have the opportunity to speak? In some cases, he says no. And this is good. Because if he is now irritated or in some business. And we will try to discuss. But this will definitely not work. And I like it. I always said. Pyotr Petrovich, when will it be more convenient for you for me to call you back? It is psychologically difficult for a person to say never. True. If you talk to him politely and respectfully. And he calls for some time. And look. When he calls for some time. Internally, including for himself. He also accepted that it would be convenient for him for me to call him back. That he has something to do with it. It sounds as if we are hypnotizing a person. No. We are not hypnotizing. But there is such a concept. Not direct impressions. The field of Erikson hypnosis. These are some very soft. Such very touching things. As if they are shards. You know. When I was not the first to study Erikson hypnosis. It suddenly came to me. Whether we want it or not. We do these indirect impressions all the time. And receive. And again. There is no question of doing it or not. We all do it. Just notice what kind of impressions we make unnecessary. Unnecessary. And it is better to avoid some wrong impressions. Our own children.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction and Setting the Tone\\nText: Or our business potential partners. And rely on some reasonable impressions. Because if I tell him with a slightly different intonation. Do you have the opportunity to speak now? I instill in him that I am not sure of something. And you don't have to deal with me. If I tell him. Do you have the opportunity to speak now? A small emphasis. Do you hear again? Yes. Do you have? You can nod a little bit at this point. Even if he doesn't see you. Do you have the opportunity to speak now? Do you hear the warm voice? You don't hear, right? On equal terms, right from the intonation of the formal question. Warm. We make this small, unclear hint to a person. That he now has the opportunity to speak. Okay.\\n\\n## Section 2: Setting up a Business Meeting\\nText: When a person says yes. We say. Peter Petrovich. I'm calling to set up a business meeting. Its goal is to find out if it is possible to apply artificial intelligence in your company. So that it is really interesting and useful for you. Remember the mission in the world of the client. The meeting will take 15-20 minutes. Is it possible? Look, you can change the text yourself. You can speak more broadly. Because you heard that in the example that Dmitry spoke, he spoke more broadly. There was such a clarification that, in fact, did not take much time. But there was every phrase clear, clear, interchangeable. One came out of the other. And it sounded very convincing and very logical. Please, you can, as in the example that Dmitry quoted. And you can try it short and so and so. But the most important thing is the goal of your call. The goal of the call itself is to set up a meeting. There is no other goal for a cold call. No. The goal of the meeting itself. The meeting can be online. Please, in Zoom, in Skype, in WhatsApp, in Facebook. It doesn't matter. In Telegram. Its goal is to find out. Well, actually, you are talking. Be sure to benefit. Not that you want to offer them something. There must be some benefit for them, for their companies.\\n\\n## Section 3: Cold Call Techniques and Duration of the Meeting\\nText: And the following. You mean time. There is the best book on cold calls that I know. Steven Schiffman. Or in another transcription, Stefan Schiffman. Steven Schiffman. Cold Call Techniques. The best book I've ever read on this topic. So, from what Steven Schiffman offers, I don't use two thirds. I use one third. And thanks to this third. I really made a lot of money. So, one of the points that Steven Schiffman does not recommend is to talk about the duration of the meeting. Well, as if this is some kind of restriction in which we drive ourselves in advance. I use 10-15 minutes. This is possible. 15-20 minutes. This is possible. Why does it work? Clearness. Additional clarity. When the person understands what we offer, what he agrees on. It removes additional stress from him. That is, any choice has its pros and cons. You can do it your own way. But I know for sure that 10-15 minutes was really enough for my meeting, and with an eye-to-eye approach, with a date. With an explanation of all the issues. And with the fact that I said goodbye to him, briefly telling him that I can do something for him that I cannot, and that I am not afraid of what happens. I can do something for him that I can't, and they agreed that I would send him a commercial offer. Very often, when a person is attracted, time has passed, 15 minutes have passed, I have always reminded that Petr Petrovich, we agreed here 15 minutes, now 15 minutes is nothing. A person, when he is attracted, said nothing, and could sit for an hour and a half, but this is his choice, if we both have time, why not. So it's possible, so it's possible, this is a modification of opportunity, this is an allegation to inattention, that the meeting takes 15-20 minutes, it's nonsense, it's not much, it's possible. Psychologically and logically, it's easier to say yes to it.\\n\\n## Section 4: Reproducing Effective Techniques and Attention to Details\\nText: I just wanted to say «In fact, weockey is difficult» What we talked about. If it was possible to agree on a meeting, but not with the Director, you will remember Nikolai Nikolaevich, if you like everything and you want to use AI technology, if it is possible, it is possible. someone with whom it will be necessary to agree on this decision if there is he says there is a director of the film director Nikolai Nikolayevich and we can then meet together with him or with them, yes, we have settled on the time, namely in a cold contact, I definitely did not say everything that can be said on this topic the skeleton is the main thing that in two and a half hours it was very important to talk to you and give a presentation in full volume with us then completely what I thought it was possible to start in this webinar the technique of cold calls what we start the meeting with what we take the first part of the meeting is not cold and the technique of the funnel of questions what questions we ask when the orientation interest has already become clear to warm up this interest so that a person was ready to pay for this value with the money it costs it will be our topic for the next webinar and yes now I will see what they wrote what about inalpi you will tell erection like hypnosis they take gun I one look at neurolinguistic programming in fact, this is everything very simple this is the basis here, yes, and I don't want people to put their hands here for a long time, we will definitely adjust it, especially with this story, because here you will focus on snacking, considering The idea is that we see what works for some professionals, for some people, and pay attention to the nuances, to the details. Where is the intonation, where is the pause, the expression of the face? Most often, people themselves do not realize why it is effective. We notice it, and then we can reproduce it ourselves and teach other people. There is no mysticism, there is nothing supernatural and miraculous, not in NLP, not in any other learning technologies. It's just attention to the details that work in practice and reproduction.\\n\\n## Section 1: Introduction to the webinar\\nText: In any case, I gave you all our today's webinar with things that I really did for 15 years, in very different contexts, in very different cities, and they work. I think they will work exactly the same for you. Thank you.\\n\\n## Section 2: Closing remarks and next meeting announcement\\nText: I said, on equal terms, directly with the intonation of the formal question, that is, without any doubt and with sincere warmth. Friends, that's it, I took three minutes of your time. Until the next meeting, and perhaps Dmitry will want to say something at the end, I don't know. Yes, colleagues, see you all. We will meet with you in a week, there will be my meeting, we will also analyze examples of application, evaluation, and so on.\\n\\n## Section 3: Contact information and future meeting details\\nText: If you have any questions, write to me. If you have any specific requests, write to me in Telegram in person or in the chat, mark me. And in a week or so, on the 28th, there will be a second meeting with Evgeny. If you have any questions, prepare them to be asked, and there will be more details about Voronka. Thank you.\\n\\n## Section 4: Farewell and closing remarks\\nText: Yes, have a good day to everyone. Yes, all the best. Colleagues, Domashka. There will be no Domashka this week. Just try it, practice everything that was today. Next week there will be Domashka from me, as usual, according to the evaluation and so on. All good luck to everyone, bye everyone.\\n\\n\""

              " Document(page_content=\"Text: Look, there are only four communication strategies. I'll open it now. It is also worth paying attention to when we talk. The first strategy is passive. All these strategies came to us from the animal world. Except for the confident one. When two cobras meet at a dog wedding, one of them can lie on his back and put his throat. Just don't hit his head. Or squeeze his tail and run away. Or run past a dog wedding. It's all bad, it's insidious. I'll go to the library and read books. Passive strategy is from below. This is the state when we at least a little bit at the moment of the conversation we feel like a beggar who tears off a big important uncle or a seriously busy aunt from her real affairs. And then someone begs to pay attention to us. And again, it's okay if you hear it from yourself. And you will definitely hear it at some point. The fact is that the passive strategy is from below. Such an insecure one from below. My dear. And confident communication, the intonation of confident communication, the look of confident communication, and so on. I set myself. I learned this in steps. And this is only through practice, only through training. And therefore, on the first contacts, on the first steps, remember, I said, allow yourself to be imperfect. You have no goal to do everything right. The goal is just to do it at least. Once. This is completely normal. In any area. And including in the field of cold contacts and meetings. Therefore, just notice. The voice trembled. Somehow they began to twist something in their hands. These which I have now sound. I'm worried. I think about how to fit a large volume, to give you some live pulse beat, which is on sale, which I really like, and which is true, some things that work. And at the same time, I remember that we are now with you two and a half hours. And I'm a little worried now and I'm worried to take all this into account. And this excitement is expressed in the fact that I can echo, I can speak in a hurry. And when I notice it, then I can somehow deal with it. Or wave your hand. Okay, let's admit my mistakes now. It's okay, the point is more important. Don't get distracted, Zhenya. Do as it turns out. Or I can pay attention to echo less, relax. And in any case, the intonation from below is very characteristic. Piotr Petrovich, tell me, what is it related to that is important for you? Well, I'm exaggerating now, it's clear. Aggressive. Aggressive strategy is when Kobel starts to attack, try to tear the throat and so on. And here is an interesting thing. Aggressive behavior strategy also refers to unconfident behavior. Super confidence is a mask of uncertainty. And this happens, well, less often, of course, but it also happens when you suddenly notice that you start to communicate with the interlocutor from above. It's a little bit like you're talking to him as a school teacher. I suppose that in your sales this can also sometimes occur, because the area for a person is most likely completely new and unfamiliar. And he can be rude, because he is a serious person, he is very professional in his field, but he encounters what he does not know, but you know. And he can involuntarily find out his ignorance, and we, also out of fear, can start to dictate something to him. And here, too, it is very important, and it is not confidence, in fact. It is just in this situation that it is important to notice it in the position of equals. Because even if we will dictate something from the position of a school teacher to the head, he will remember it later, he will have unpleasant associations. We correct ourselves. It's okay. It's important to notice it and correct it at the moment. But manipulative is when we start to cheat somehow. When a dog comes to us, we start to look at him with devoted, devoted eyes. The owner will be a bastard if you do not feed him. Friends, in sales, I am not going to teach you some manipulative behavior strategy, deception, bluff. Practical psychology is the psychology of influence. We are learning how to influence the interlocutor, but it is influenced by an ethical purpose. What is active ethical sales? It is to buy. In this case, he did not plan to buy the implementation of the artificial intelligence in his organization. He did not have such thoughts. But he bought and did not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he addresses you again and recommends you to his acquaintances. But initially, this is what he did not plan. Or a person planned to buy something for less money. And he bought more or for more money and does not regret it. Neither a month nor a year later he is happy to recommend you to his acquaintances. He addresses you again.

Yes, we turn to equals. When a person can be status. And when you start working in your profession. For example, when I started working as a business coach, I perceived my status and the status as the head of the organization as very different. Because he is in his profession already firmly standing on his feet. And I am a novice business coach. He earns serious money. He earns serious money. This is now I suspect that at least in some cases I as a psychologist and business coach can earn on average and more than many of the managers with whom I talk. With whom I sell my services. But at the beginning of my activity there is no. Many years are not the first. And then I was working and it is natural. And here it was important to remind myself that I am not his subordinate. Yes, he is an important person in his organization, but I am outside his hierarchy. And in any case, I can recognize his status, his merits, respect him as a person, as a person and show this respect in our conversation.

Again, now the most important thing to pay attention to is the correspondence with these four things. But I can't help but say it. Dmitry is doing the so-called program setting.

Well, you can't, it's impossible. If you haven't asked the person, it's in vain to offer him something, to tell him. It will be missed, it will not be for him. Therefore, I always take initiative into my own hands. And I say, Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask you a few questions? Let it be. After the 24th year, they always say yes. There was not a single case in my practice, well, in real meetings, if we had already agreed on a meeting about sales, that a person would say no to me. Again, do you hear how these four criteria sound? Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask him a few questions?

At the stage of the offer, I start with the minuses of my offer. At the stage of finding out the needs, we will talk to you about the funnel of questions. And then I will tell you. At some point I will definitely say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that you are simply guided. That is, I tell him again that I'm not trying to sell him now, he needs to make a decision about the purchase now. Or I can say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. I'm not selling you now, and this is very important. This is very relaxing for a person and causes trust.

            "=====================Text: Look, very often, it's really funny. I agreed on a meeting, and here we meet with the interlocutor, and he is a little confused. Well, we met, but how to say. And out of this confusion, a person usually comes out. In such a way that he offers to tell something to me. He says, Evgeny, well, tell me about your proposal. Well, you can't, it's impossible. If you haven't asked the person, it's in vain to offer him something, to tell him. It will be missed, it will not be for him. Therefore, I always take initiative into my own hands. And I say, Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask you a few questions? Let it be. After the 24th year, they always say yes. There was not a single case in my practice, well, in real meetings, if we had already agreed on a meeting about sales, that a person would say no to me. Again, do you hear how these four criteria sound? Pyotr Petrovich, so that I can say that it can really be interesting and useful for you. Can I ask him a few questions? And the setting of the program. And the second thing that sounded great here in this excerpt is that Dmitry gives the opportunity to the interlocutor to say no. He directly says that we don't know if it will come in handy or not. But if it doesn't come in handy, well, we just won't continue, it's reasonable. And this is a very important thing. Remember, the main fear of the buyer, we said at the very beginning, is the fear of unwanted external subconscious influence. That somehow your teeth will speak to you. And you will spend money, and then you will feel like a fool. So when we speak confidently, and at the same time I specifically at each stage of sales, I just came to the fact that at each stage of sales I am building up this opportunity to say no. At the stage of the offer, I start with the minuses of my offer. At the stage of finding out the needs, we will talk to you about the funnel of questions. And then I will tell you. At some point I will definitely say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that you are simply guided. That is, I tell him again that I'm not trying to sell him now, he needs to make a decision about the purchase now. Or I can say, Piotr Petrovich, I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. I'm not selling you now, and this is very important. This is very relaxing for a person and causes trust. This is just what is now. I understand that your interest is of a preliminary nature. That is, I'm not selling you now and this is very important.\n",

We will also discuss the importance of the sales funnel and its role in the sales process. This webinar will provide valuable information that is not easily accessible elsewhere. While there are books and online resources available, they may not offer the same level of quality and proven techniques. Our sales department has already benefited from this training, and it is highly recommended for anyone interested in improving their sales skills. Although there will be some mention of artificial intelligence, this webinar primarily focuses on sales techniques rather than AI integration. Feel free to ask questions in the chat, and if you are interested in integrating sales with AI, let us know. Prepare practical questions for future webinars as we plan to explore the integration of sales with artificial intelligence. This webinar is primarily centered around selling, with a particular emphasis on IT outsourcing.\n",

            "\n",
            "The main fear of the seller is the fear of rejection, specifically the fear of being told no to their offer. This fear arises when selling services to people who are not their customers and who are not actively seeking their services. Sellers often experience anxiety when they need to make calls, arrange meetings, or make offers to potential buyers.\n",

            "On the other hand, the main fear of the buyer is the fear of being deceived. Buyers are wary of being sold something they did not specifically ask for or being pressured into making a purchase. They may also fear encountering negative emotions or feeling imposed upon during the sales process.\n",

            "## Understanding Shame\n",
            "\n",
            "Shame is the fear of rejection and the belief that one's actions will make others perceive them as unworthy or bad. It is the fear of losing social status and being rejected by significant people. Shame is a painful and unpleasant experience that often goes unnoticed as people tend to avoid situations that may trigger this feeling.\n",

            "## Overcoming Procrastination and Fear of Rejection\n",
            "\n",
            "- Procrastination is often caused by the fear of rejection and the shame associated with it.\n",
            "- The fear of rejection can lead to delaying sales activities, even when a clear plan is in place.\n",
            "- It is important to address the underlying reasons for the fear of rejection in order to overcome procrastination.\n",
            "- Understanding why rejection is feared and developing strategies to cope with it can help in taking action and making sales calls.\n",

            "## Fear of Incompetence\n",
            "\n",
            "- Fear of incompetence is a common challenge in sales.\n",
            "- The fear arises when transitioning to a new professional area, such as sales.\n",
            "- It is important to acknowledge and address this fear.\n",

            "\n",
            "- The main thing in any business is to understand whether there are any abnormalities or pathologies.\n",
            "- For professionals selling their services, the main thing is to make contacts and communicate effectively.\n",
            "- It is important to allow yourself to make mistakes and not strive for perfection.\n",
            "- Responding to fears and taking action is crucial, rather than being perfect.\n",
